"""hook_dispatch.py - run every hook of one event in ONE python process instead of one process per hook.

WHY (measured 2026-09-15 on <hostname>): a Bash tool call fires 12 PreToolUse + 5 PostToolUse hooks, each a separate
python start. On a quiet box that set costs 4.7 s of CPU; under the day's real load the same set measured 70.8 s, with
single hooks at 4-6 s. Nearly all of it is interpreter startup and re-importing the same modules (json, psutil, the brain
libraries) seventeen times. One process imports them once.

USAGE (the wiring, once proven):
    python -s ~/.claude/dreaming/hook_dispatch.py --event PreToolUse
replaces every individual entry for that event in settings.json. The dispatcher reads the SAME settings.json, so the hook
list stays where it has always been - it just runs the entries itself.

FAITHFUL SEMANTICS (the whole point of the equivalence control beside it, hook_dispatch_control.py):
  - stdin is replayed to every hook, exactly as the harness would
  - stdout: each hook's stdout is parsed; JSON hookSpecificOutput objects are merged (additionalContext joined with a
    blank line, in hook order); plain text is appended as-is. A hook that prints nothing contributes nothing.
  - permissionDecision: deny wins over ask wins over allow; the first denying hook's reason is used
  - exit code 2 (block) from any hook -> the dispatcher exits 2 with that hook's stderr, which is how every gate on this
    box (the ack-gate, proof_deny) stops a tool call. Any other non-zero exit is non-blocking: logged, never propagated.
  - a hook that raises, or calls sys.exit(n), is caught: SystemExit(0/None) is success, SystemExit(2) blocks, anything
    else is a non-blocking error. A crashing hook can never take the others down.
  - isolation between hooks: os.environ, sys.argv, sys.path and the working directory are saved and restored around each
    one. sys.modules is deliberately NOT reset - the shared import cache is the saving.
  - a hook whose command is not a simple "python <file>" form (the error_graph -c payload) is run as a subprocess, as before.

SAFETY: the dispatcher only runs when ~/.claude/dreaming/HOOK_DISPATCH_ENABLED exists; without it, it exits 0
silently and the individually-wired hooks keep running. Log: ~/.claude/compute/hook_dispatch.log (errors and
timings only, one line per invocation).

#
# So the hot path finishes in under 4 s at p90 and the 120 s ceiling only ever applies to a hook that has
# already failed - and when it applies to PreToolUse, a tool call appears to hang for nearly four minutes.
# The per-hook failure lines in that log are all the same number: project_memory_hook.py 17 of 17 at a
# median 120.07 s, project_memory_hot_hook.py 12 of 12 at 120.06, error_monitor.py 120.02. They are not
# slow, they are timing out as their normal behaviour, and the budget is what sets the price of that.
# SessionStart keeps the full 120 s ON PURPOSE: it fires once and it is where the brain is loaded, so
# cutting it wakes a session without its identity - a different and worse failure than a lost note.
#
# EVERY CAP WAS CHECKED AGAINST HOW MANY REAL RUNS IT WOULD CUT, and that check overturned my first
# choice. I had written 30 s for UserPromptSubmit on the assumption that its 32.6 s p90 was inflated by
# the timeouts themselves. It is not: with every run over 100 s removed, 779 of 792 remain and their p90
# is still **29.84 s**, p99 71.09, max 97.54. A 30 s cap would have cut 89 of 792 runs - more than one
# prompt in nine losing its hook output - because this event genuinely takes 12-30 s. The prompt path
# being that slow is a finding of its own; it is not a reason to throw its work away. 90 s sits above the
# clean maximum and only touches runs already past anything that has ever completed.
# What each cap actually cuts, measured on 22,009 log lines:
#     PreToolUse       15 s   60 of 12,281 runs (0.49%)   saves   932 s

# hour: the strong-nodes hook moved in-process when a peer improved the argv parsing, exited 2 on a missing argument,
# and blocked every tool call in every session on the machine until the owner ran the rollback by hand. Passing its
# argv through fixed the argument error and it STILL fails in-process for a second reason.
# So the default is now the old, safe path - a subprocess - and a hook earns the fast path only by being proven
# equivalent. hook_dispatch_control.py writes this file after a passing run, listing the hooks whose in-process
# output matched their own subprocess exactly. An unknown hook, a new hook, or a hook edited since the last control
# run is simply not in the list, and runs the way it always did.

# read the file twice and compiled the whole source. Measured 13 Oct 20:15 under a dream's load: 166 ms of a Bash
# PreToolUse across its 205 in-process hooks (191 of them film hooks) and 372 ms of a UserPromptSubmit, against 10 and
# 17 ms from kept code objects (primary_directive/improve_1012/fronts/R24/runs/measure_compile_1.txt). So each event
# keeps its hooks' code objects in one file in the __pycache__ beside this one, keyed on the exact path string and its
# abspath, the file's size and mtime in ns; the file name carries the interpreter (hexversion, -O) so two Pythons never
# overwrite each other's. A kept object is the one compile(source, path, "exec") returned for that file, and the hook
# runs through runpy._run_module_code - the function run_path itself ends in - with the arguments run_path gives it. A
# miss does what run_path does first (no importer for the path, not a compiled file), compiles, and is kept. Anything
# unusual before the hook starts gives None and runpy.run_path runs exactly as before. One difference, by design: a
# compile-time SyntaxWarning prints on the dispatch that compiles the hook, as an import's does, not on every call (the
# merge reads stderr only from a blocking hook). Like a .pyc, a kept object goes stale only if a file is rewritten at the

# get the payload with every envelope removed - his own words, when he typed some beside it - and are skipped when
