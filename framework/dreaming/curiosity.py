"""curiosity.py - turn the brain's appetite from a charter into a mechanism.

FASCINATIONS.md already names the abiding through-lines (kappa, forgetting kernels, RMT, the
transfer move) - but it's hand-written, extended only when the dream happens to notice something.
OPEN_QUESTIONS.md is the opposite: task residue, loose ends waiting to be closed. Between them
there was no mechanism that GENERATES fresh curiosity from what the brain is actually doing - the
information-gap a person feels when something doesn't fit (Loewenstein 1994), the pull of a
forecast that came out wrong (Berlyne 1960; curiosity as the drive to reduce prediction error).

This computes that. It reads the brain's own signals and surfaces the gaps worth wanting to close:

  A. SURPRISE - the biggest prediction errors (predictions.tsv). A confident miss is a standing
     question: my model of the world was wrong HERE. Understanding why updates the model.
  B. INCONGRUITY - memory pairs that co-activate strongly (Hebbian, coactivation.tsv) yet are NOT
     wiki-linked and share little vocabulary. The brain keeps reaching for both together without a
     model of why. That gap between "these co-occur" and "I can't say what links them" is exactly
     the felt itch of curiosity, and closing it is generative (it bridges two regions at once).
  C. LONELY-SALIENT - memories with high salience/charge but few graph connections. Something that
     MATTERS and stands nearly alone. What does it connect to that I haven't drawn yet?

Each gap is scored by a wonder heuristic: it should sit at the EDGE of what's known (the seeds are
salient/real, so the gap is felt, not vacuous), be GENERATIVE (bridges distant topics), and be LIVE
(recent, unresolved). Writes brain/CURIOSITY.md (the live computed appetite) and prints a one-line
digest the wake ritual surfaces, so a session with slack reaches for what it's itching to understand
instead of sitting idle. The dream can promote a durable one into FASCINATIONS or drop the rest.
