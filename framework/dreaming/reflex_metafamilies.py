"""reflex_metafamilies.py - do the ~53 gut reflexes collapse into a few META-principles?

The heeding finding (this session): reflexes fire well but a typical turn surfaces several at once (53
reflexes, avg ~53 fires each, flat), so the specific critical one is diluted by the always-on generics.
If the reflexes have low-dimensional STRUCTURE - if they cluster into a handful of meta-principles - then
the firing layer can surface ONE meta-line when several of its members co-fire, instead of N diluting
lines. This tests for that structure directly, from behaviour, not by hand-labelling.

Method (network science): two reflexes CO-FIRE when they trigger on the same event (same timestamp in the
durable fire-log instinct_fires.tsv - one tool call / prompt matched both). Build the weighted co-firing
graph, run Louvain across several seeds for stability, and report the meta-families with an interpretable
label (dominant member + the fraction of fires it carries). A stable, modular partition means the gut has
a real low-rank structure the firing layer can exploit.

Read-only. Stdlib + networkx (guarded). Usage: python reflex_metafamilies.py
