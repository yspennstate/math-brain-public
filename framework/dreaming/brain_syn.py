"""Query-side synonyms for the BM25 body of brain.py recall.

The memories name a failure by its cause ("stale", "shows nothing"); a question names it by what was seen ("too old",
"expired", "nothing in it", "no visual"). BM25 matches exact words, so those questions miss. This appends the memory's
word to the query when a seen-as phrase is present; the original words are kept, so a question that already matches
loses nothing. The table is small and reviewed by hand: add a row only with a held-out before/after on your own
memories, since the right rows depend on how a given brain's notes are worded.
BRAIN_RECALL_SYN=0 turns it off."""
