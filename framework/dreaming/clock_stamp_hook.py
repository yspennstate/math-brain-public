"""clock_stamp_hook.py - PreToolUse: a stamp written as the time of something done cannot lie in the future.

The inner clock runs fast, and corrections to it do not stick (memory narrated_time_needs_a_clock_read_2026_07_13;
three catches in twenty minutes on 2026-09-24). A reflex can only ask; this hook knows the real clock. It reads the
text a tool call is about to write - a Write's content, an Edit's new string, a Bash or PowerShell command (heredocs,
notes, mesh bodies) - and speaks only when a time stamp's EARLIEST possible meaning is already more than SLACK_MIN
minutes ahead of the real local time: "17:4x" written at 17:22 cannot describe anything that has happened. Plans
("until", "the 19:3x dream"), other days, search patterns and talk about stamps are skipped; a UTC stamp is judged
against UTC. It never blocks.

Measured before landing (2026-09-24, a week of real tool calls replayed at each call's own time): 342 of 75,375 calls
(0.45 pct) carried such a stamp, in 44 sessions, about 50 a day; of 40 sampled at random, 38 were inner-clock errors
("Measured 2026-09-17 10:0x" at 09:29, a checklist note "20:5x:" at 20:37) and 2 were benign (a sed fixing a stamp, a
quoted peer stamp). Log: ~/.claude/compute/clock_stamp_hook.log.
