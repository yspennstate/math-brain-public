"""heed_weekly_report.py - warning-interaction telemetry, delivered on a cadence.

The 07-28 finding behind this: every heeding metric already existed (ack_log, heed_log,
heed_trend, the report-gate shadow rows) and none of them reached the owner - "a fire-rate
dashboard can look healthy while every fire gets skimmed" cuts both ways: a heed record
nobody reads changes nothing. This writes a short dated report with mechanically
defensible layers: unique deny keys, matching token-registration receipts,
action-class associations in the small scored Claude subset, report-gate blocks,
durable-ledger entries, and retrieval-spine freshness. A token receipt is not
proof of comprehension, execution, safe outcome, or causal heeding; missing
receipt is outcome unknown.
Sections fail soft - a broken input becomes a line saying so, never a dead report.
