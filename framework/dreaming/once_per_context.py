"""Send a hook's standing text once per context, then only what changed (4 Nov 2026).

Measured on 24 h of the hook dispatcher's overflow files on the first deployment: most hook
text is the same paragraph re-sent on every prompt to a session that already has it - waste_sense 1,926 chars a
fire, 95 pct repeated. A context keeps what it was told until a compaction, so a standing paragraph needs to go
whole once per context (again after a compaction or after `resend` seconds) and otherwise not at all.

    from once_per_context import filter_lines
    out, whole, at = filter_lines(session_id, "waste_sense", lines, keep=lambda l: l.startswith("  - pid"))

Lines are keyed with their digits masked, so a census count that moved does not count as new text. `keep` names
lines that always go (the live part). Any doubt (no session, unreadable state or compaction index) sends it whole.
ONCE_PER_CONTEXT_OFF=1 turns it off for every hook.
