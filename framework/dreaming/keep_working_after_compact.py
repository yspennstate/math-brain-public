"""Stop hook: the first time a session tries to stop after a compaction, send it back to its open work.

Design goal (16 Oct 2026): after a compaction an agent keeps working on its open tasks. Seen the same
night: after a compaction an agent writes a recap of where it stands and ends the turn, although its tasks are still open
and nothing is waiting on the user. The SessionStart notes (CP17, CP39, CP40) only
add context; they cannot make the agent take another turn. A Stop hook that answers {"decision": "block"} can.

Rules: once per compaction (keyed by the compact_boundary record's uuid), never while stop_hook_active (no loops), only
when the compaction is in the transcript's last 3 MB and under 6 hours old, and only when the checklist holds open or
working entries under this session's agent id. The reason tells the agent it may stop with one line when everything is
done or waiting on the user or a running job, so a finished agent pays one short turn, nothing more. Silent on any error.
Fires are logged to ~/.claude/brain_graph/compactions/keep_working_fires.jsonl."""
