"""predict.py - score the brain's predictions, so it learns from surprise.

The brain is a prediction machine (predictive processing: Rao-Ballard 1999; Friston; Clark 2013).
It should forecast and then learn from the gap. The learning signal is prediction ERROR / surprise,
not the outcome itself (Rescorla-Wagner 1972; Schultz 1997 - dopamine encodes reward-prediction-error).

This reads the append-only ledger memory/PREDICTIONS.md, scores every RESOLVED bet with two proper
measures, and writes:
  - predictions.tsv       (id, scope, p, outcome, brier, surprise_bits, claim)  for dream.py
  - <brain>/PREDICTIONS.md (open bets + a calibration read)                      for the wake ritual

Scores (Brier 1950; self-information):
  brier    = (p - o)^2                         lower is better; a proper scoring rule
  surprise = -log2( p if hit else 1-p )  bits  a CONFIDENT miss is maximally surprising; a hedged one barely
Calibration per scope: mean Brier, and mean-p vs hit-rate (over/under-confidence). An un-timestamped
prediction is worthless (hindsight rewrites "I knew it"), so only dated, resolved bets are scored.

Pure read-only over the memory dir. Usage: python predict.py [memory_dir]
