Mechanical half of the dreaming system. Scans the live memory corpus and emits
DREAM_AGENDA.md: what tonight's REM session (a headless Claude) should replay,
consolidate, reconcile, and check. No LLM here - just selection heuristics that
mimic sleep pressure: recency, similarity-without-connection, contradiction,
staleness, and a dash of random replay.
