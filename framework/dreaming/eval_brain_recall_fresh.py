"""Fresh recall test for the memory brain: owner-voice questions, gold memory slugs, hit@1 / hit@5 through brain.py recall.

Authored 2026-09-03 19:0x on the owner's ask "i want another test to see how it is doing" - the other half of
the campaign's object. Each question is worded the way he asks (short, his spelling left alone, no slug words),
and the gold is the memory that answers it. A miss is either recall ranking the wrong memory or the memory
being worded so that his question cannot find it - both are the brain's problem. Re-run for the trend.
