"""recall_rewrite.py - brain.py recall with a cheap rewrite first, for a question asked in everyday words.

The brain's search is lexical, so a question in everyday words misses the note about half the time. On 300 reworded
questions, three Haiku 4.5 rewrites, each in the words a note answering the question would use, plus the question
itself put the source memory in the top five of one of the four searches for 132 of 300, against 104 for the question
alone (+9 points; top twenty +14), at under a cent a question. This runs the same four searches and interleaves them -
the first result of each, then the second of each, and so on - so its first twenty lines are the four top-fives when
the lists share no memory; a memory two lists share is shown once (each list is searched ten deep at -n 20).
Read at the same number of lines, the interleaved list is a wash against plain recall - 109 against 105 at five lines,
150 against 149 at twenty - so it is a second look, not a better first search: after a plain recall missed, its
twenty lines held the note 25 times in 151.

Cost: one headless Haiku call through the Claude Code CLI (--safe-mode, no tools, 5-10 s) and four recalls. Use it
when a plain recall misses; brain.py recall itself is unchanged. Every use is logged to
~/.claude/brain_graph/live/recall_rewrite_log.jsonl (RECALL_REWRITE_NO_LOG=1 skips it). Without the CLI, give your own
rewrites with --rewrites, or --no-model for the plain search.
