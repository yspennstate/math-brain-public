"""verify_sense.py - UserPromptSubmit: when the work will produce a proof, a code change or a number, hand the agent
the checks that could fail on it before it starts (owner, 30 Sep 2026 01:10).

The design goal: hooks prompt agents to check proofs, ideas and code with Lean, to audit their
work, and to plan how to verify it in more than one way. The card is short and concrete - the route for
this kind of work, the command that runs it, and the rung the claim is allowed to reach - because a reminder to be
careful measured as noise (the 30 Sep design review: "a reminder is not a verifier"). verify_gate.py is the other end:
at the Stop it blocks once when the report claims more than the turn checked.

One card per kind of work (math, code, result) per session, again after three hours. Silent on status questions and
errands. Runs for Claude (hook_dispatch) and Codex (hooks.json); the output is the JSON both accept. Fail-safe silent.
