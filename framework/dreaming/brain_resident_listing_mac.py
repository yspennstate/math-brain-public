"""brain_resident_listing_mac.py - the memory folder's listing kept resident in the brain recall server, on macOS.

The macOS counterpart of brain_resident_listing.py (the laptop's, on ReadDirectoryChangesW). Every time the recall
server drops its folder memos (a memory written anywhere, or its 120 s timer), brain._bulk_listing re-walks the
46k-entry memory folder with its stats: 86 ms on a quiet machine and 160 ms p50 inside the server (6 Nov 2026). This
module keeps {name: _BulkEntry} and the folder's order, and on each listing:

1. makes the FSEvents count current (mac_folder_watch.barrier: a sentinel write that must come back, about 11 ms);
2. re-reads with lstat only the names that had an event, building each entry the way _bulk_listing does;
3. when a name came or went, takes the order from os.listdir, which returns the same order as getattrlistbulk (both
   read the folder's B-tree; equal on all 46,233 names, and that order is ascending APFS name hash then name bytes,
   0 violations), and checks the names match the entries it holds, lstat-ing any extra and dropping any missing.
An unchanged file keeps its entry object, so brain._sup_rows' per-entry cache can hit (it was built for the laptop's
resident listing and never hit on macOS).

Falls back to a full _bulk_listing when the watcher cannot vouch for its count (barrier timeout, dropped events, a
root change), when an entry is neither a file nor a folder (then the full walk returns None and the caller uses
os.scandir, as before), and at least every FULL_EVERY seconds. The last bounds one known blind spot: a write into a
file still held open raises no event until it is closed, so its size and mtime would otherwise stay old (none was
held open for writing in the memory folder when checked, 6 Nov). BRS_RESIDENT_LISTING=0 turns this off.
