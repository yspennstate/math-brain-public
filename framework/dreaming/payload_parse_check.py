"""REFUTED 2026-08-17 - DO NOT WIRE THIS. Kept for the negative result, not for use.

MEASURED against 1,004 untruncated Bash commands from session transcripts: 361 carried an
extractable Python payload, 40 were flagged as not compiling, and only 5 of those 40 actually
failed. 87.5 percent false positives.

WHY IT CANNOT WORK, which is the useful part. The flagged commands are overwhelmingly of the form
    ssh box 'python3 -c "..."'   or   cd X && python - <<PY ... PY
where what I extract from the command STRING is not what Python eventually receives. A shell layer
rewrites quotes and backslashes on the way, and THAT REWRITE IS THE BUG THE CHECK WAS HUNTING. A
static pre-execution parse check reads the text before the corrupting transformation happens, so it
is structurally blind to the failure it exists for and noisy about everything else.

WHAT THIS LEAVES. The reflex's own existing advice is the complete fix and needs no detector:
"when a payload needs quotes-inside-quotes or newlines, stop nesting: Write it to a temp .py and
run the file - one quoting layer, zero escapes." That removes the shell transformation instead of
trying to predict it. A check that could work would have to sit where Python receives the bytes
(an audit hook inside the interpreter), not where the shell command is composed.

Original docstring follows.
