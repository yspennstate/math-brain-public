"""owner_law.py - one command turns an owner warning into an armed, standing law.

The 07-28 finding behind this: the owner's repeated warnings ("real bid/ask only", "never
sell options") took multiple tellings because each landed in one weak channel. The channels
that measurably hold are (1) CLAUDE.md - loaded into every session of every agent at start,
the data law held end-to-end there - and (2) dream-compiled act-site reflexes with controls.
This arms both from one sentence: append a dated law block to CLAUDE.md, file an
owner-stated brain node whose body carries an explicit COMPILE REQUEST the nightly dream's
agenda sampling picks up (compilation stays with the dream machinery and its positive and
negative controls - auto-compiling here would bypass the dilution guard).

Usage:
  python owner_law.py "never start a second Theta Terminal against the live MDDS server"
  python owner_law.py --title the data vendor-single-terminal "never start a second ..."
  python owner_law.py --dry-run "..."        # print what would be written, write nothing
  python owner_law.py --no-broadcast "..."   # skip the live-session mailbox broadcast

Delivery legs: (1) CLAUDE.md block - every FUTURE session; (2) owner-stated brain node with a
dream COMPILE REQUEST - the act-site reflex; (3) fleet mailbox broadcast - every session with
a transcript active in the last 6h gets the law injected at its next tool call or stop
(mailbox_hook; transport live-proven 2026-07-28). Note /btw is NOT a delivery channel: it is
a side-question overlay whose text never enters the agent's transcript by design.

Meant to be run BY the owner or by an agent relaying the owner's words verbatim in the
current session. It must never be fed invented or paraphrased-into-stronger text: the law
block quotes the sentence as given.
