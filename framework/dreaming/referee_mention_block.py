"""referee_mention_block.py - REFEREE precision test for graph_fire/pre_report at the Stop surface.

The named open gap: "the pre-report check can't tell reporting a
wrong number from *discussing* one (the mention-vs-act problem)." The completion-claim path is act-gated
(observed) and hedge-gated; the stat/strong paths are hedge-gated; but the anchor-MISMATCH path
(should_block includes bool(mism)) is NEITHER hedge- nor act-gated. So a message that QUOTES or CORRECTS a
wrong number (not asserts it fresh) may false-block.

This measures the false-block rate on MENTION/discussion prose vs the true-block rate on ACT/report prose.
Read-only; MEASURE, don't wire. Usage: python referee_mention_block.py
