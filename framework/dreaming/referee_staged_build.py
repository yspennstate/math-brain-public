"""referee_staged_build.py - the promote-gate for 89f84043's graph_fire mistake-catching build
(report_guards + heed_gate). Encodes THIS referee's adversarial findings as pass/GAP assertions against
the STABLE public APIs (report_guards.check_extra, heed_gate.evaluate/evidence), so it survives their
internal line-churn and can be re-run against the frozen candidate in one command.

"His 'never' is a spec for machinery" - these findings are prose in the mesh until they are a test that
fires. GAP = the referee finding is not yet addressed (do not promote); PASS = behavior is correct.
Read-only. Imports from improve_2026_07_12/ (draft) OR graph_fire/ (after integration). Usage: python referee_staged_build.py
