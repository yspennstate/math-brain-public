"""One place that knows how to read a served math-brain block.

WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-09-13 I compressed the block - dropped "source-id:" from the card label, dropped
", score N.N" from the header, folded the id onto the hint line - and broke four evaluators across three
parsers. Every one failed by reading ZERO rather than raising: own-result-card 0 of 30, served-theorem 0 of
15, SILENT 15 of 15, and a 64-character hex id being read as content numbers, all on a hook that was serving
the right card first, correctly. The nightly gate runs those four, so it would have reported a healthy brain
as broken. A peer found it and patched all four; the real defect was that four files each owned a private
regex against prose nobody had promised to keep.

So: consumers import this instead of writing their own pattern, and when the block's wording changes again -
it will - this file changes once and every instrument follows. The functions below parse STRUCTURE that
survives rewording (the id's shape, the kind bracket) and accept BOTH the pre- and post-compression forms, so
historical captures stay comparable with today's.
