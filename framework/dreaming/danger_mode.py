"""danger_mode.py - a heightened-caution STATE for high-consequence territory.

The instinct layer fires specific reflexes; this is different - a whole posture shift. When the brain
recognizes it is about to touch real money, a security credential, the owner's phone, or an
IRREVERSIBLE action on a real system, it goes EXTRA careful: slow down, pre-mortem, verify the live
state, prefer the reversible path, and for the live production stack or a secret, do NOT act without the
owner's explicit confirmation. This is the amygdala / high-reliability-org "preoccupation with failure"
made into a mode - and, per the humility focus, the humble move in danger is to verify or ASK, not to
act fast.

Detection weights ACTIONS on the live stack and secrets highest; a mere mention scores low (editing a
local copy of a production file is fine - the danger is RUNNING/changing the live thing). Fires on PreToolUse
(Bash/PowerShell/Edit/Write) and UserPromptSubmit; fail-safe silent otherwise. Never hard-blocks (the
owner acts through this brain) - it raises caution, it doesn't lock the door.
