"""fire_telemetry.py - the READER for the reflex-quality series (built 2026-07-16).

heed_trend.jsonl (nightly heed_audit --jsonl) and reflex_ranking.json's context_damp /
_damp_meta existed as of this morning with no consumer - a series nothing reads is
documentation, not telemetry. This renders a compact agenda section so every dream sees
the trend and can act on a regression (the same law that got dream_grow and prompt
classification their owners on 07-15).
