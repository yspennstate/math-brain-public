"""math_recall_prebuild.py - keep math_recall.py's prepared search ready for the math store as it is now.

The first math_recall.py call after the math store changes builds the prepared state (fastrecall.py) itself: 10 s on
the 13 Oct machine and 14 s under the A/B load, longer than a Codex tool call waits (10 s; a slower call comes back
empty). The store moves in batches, several times on a busy day. This job, run every 5 minutes by the hidden task
MathRecallPrebuild5m, opens the prepared state exactly as math_recall.py does - the same interpreter, the same store
path, the same caller file and the same MATHBRAIN_* environment, so the same cache file - and the build happens here
instead of inside somebody's question. Callers then load it in about 2 s.

A run whose store, code and environment match the last good run stops after four stat calls and a hash of the engine
sources (about half a second, below normal priority). Anything unexpected is logged and left for the next run; the
recall tool itself never depends on this job.

    python math_recall_prebuild.py           check, and open (load or build) when something moved
    python math_recall_prebuild.py --force   open the prepared state now
    python math_recall_prebuild.py --status  the last runs

Files, in the cache folder (MATH_RECALL_CACHE_DIR or ~/.claude/dreaming/cache/math_recall):
    prebuild_state.json   the last good signature and the last run (rewritten every run)
    prebuild.log          one line per run that opened the state or failed; quiet runs add nothing
