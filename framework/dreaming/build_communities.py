"""build_communities.py - group the memories into communities of the association graph, for TOPICS.md.

TOPICS.md sorted memories into five keyword buckets (build_brain_architecture.topic_of): one held 52% of the graph,
"Other" most of the rest. Louvain communities on spread_edges.tsv (resolution 1, seed 1) do far better on the same
graph (30 Oct, d2b_54_communities.py, coactivation pairs held out): modularity .143 -> .752, mean same-cluster
cosine above random +.011 -> +.056, and a session's next read lands in the cluster of the one before 53.7% of the
time against 9.9% by chance, where the buckets gave 41.8% against 26.2%.

Each community is named by the slug words most over-represented in it (count in community / expected from the whole
graph, words in at least 5 of its members) and by its best-connected member. Communities under MIN_SIZE members are
pooled as "small communities". Writes communities.tsv (slug, community number, label); the views builder groups
TOPICS.md by it while it is under 3 days old. Read-only over the memory folder.
Usage:  python build_communities.py [--quiet]
