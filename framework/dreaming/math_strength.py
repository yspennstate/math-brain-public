"""Link strengths in the math store that grow from use (claude-6bb7036b-s03, 12 Oct 2026; his 06:17 order: "edges should get
stronger as nodes that are similar are used at similar times, that strength should become automatic and agents should be
able to see the strength between nodes and use that to find information").

    python ~/.claude/dreaming/math_strength.py <card id> <card id>     how strongly two cards are tied, and by what
    python ~/.claude/dreaming/math_strength.py --card <card id>        the cards most used together with this one
    python ~/.claude/dreaming/math_strength.py --top [N]               the strongest pairs in the store
    python ~/.claude/dreaming/math_strength.py --stats                 what the log holds
    python ~/.claude/dreaming/math_strength.py --explain               this text

What counts as use. A card is USED when an agent opens it on purpose: math_recall.py --id <card>, math_walk.py <card>, or
math_note.py <card>. A card is SEEN when it is printed as a search hit (math_recall.py "<words>", math_walk.py --words).
Two cards are USED TOGETHER when, in one session, one is used and the other was used or seen in the 30 minutes before;
when the earlier card was only seen, the two must be linked and the later card must not have been a hit itself (the
agent followed the link from a hit). Two hits of the same search are never a pair: the words put them side by side,
not the agent. A pair counts once per session per day.

The strength of a pair, between 0 and 1, from the session-days in which it was used together:
    mass     = similarity x sum over those session-days of (1 + days since)^-0.5
               (power-law forgetting: a co-use today counts 1, a week ago 0.35, a month ago 0.18)
    strength = (session-days together / sqrt(session-days using the first x session-days using the second))
               x mass / (mass + 1)
The first factor keeps a card used everywhere (a hub) from tying itself to everything. similarity runs from 0.25 to 1
with the meaning of the two cards' texts (the store's bge-small claim vectors): cosine at or below 0.67, the median of
random pairs, gives 0.25; 0.83 (the upper quartile of linked pairs) or more gives 1; a card with no vector (a source,
an evidence card) gives 0.5. So similar cards used together grow fast, unrelated ones slowly. Fresh and used only
together: one session-day gives at most 0.5, three 0.75, fourteen 0.93.
Two cards with no link of their own that two or more separate sessions used together, at strength 0.25 or more, get
a LEARNED link: printed as "used together", never as a mathematical relation. Separate sessions, not separate days:
the subagents of one Claude session share its session id, and parallel subagents on unrelated topics interleave their
uses, so one session, however long and however many days it spans, is one piece of evidence for a learned link.

A printed lead earns nothing. When a tool prints a learned partner ("used together") and the agent then opens it, that
step adds nothing to the pair for the rest of that session-day: the printout suggested it, so it is not new evidence.
Without this rule a lead, once printed, would feed itself. (Links of their own grow from followed steps as usual.)

What a strength is not. It says agents found the two cards useful side by side. It does not say one proves, uses or
implies the other, and it never changes a link's kind or sign: a strong link into a conjecture does not make the
conjecture settled. Read the cards.

Automatic. math_recall.py, math_walk.py and math_note.py append the ids they print or open to
~/.claude/brain_graph/live/math_couse.jsonl (card ids, session id, time; never the words of a query). Every reader
folds whatever the log gained since the last reader into the state (math_couse_state.json beside it), so a strength
moves on the next call after the use. The log is brain data and is never deleted.

Never logged: a call whose working folder is under pd_work, primary_directive or a frozen copy of the brain, or has a
folder named test*/bench*; a call made with CLAUDE_SESSION_ID set (evaluations label their runs with it); a call on
any store but the live one; a call with no session id (CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID or CODEX_THREAD_ID); a session the
shared classifier has settled as a test worker; anything run with MATH_STRENGTH_NOLOG=1. Subagents of one Claude
session share its session id, so their uses pool as one session.
MATH_STRENGTH_OFF=1 makes the tools ignore strengths (printout and spreading exactly as before).
MATH_BRAIN_HOW_IT_WORKS.md beside this file explains the store, its links, spreading and strengths in one page.
