"""hook_dispatch_deadman.py - unwire the one-process hook dispatcher after N minutes unless it is confirmed.

Written 2026-09-17 07:0x for the case the 09-15 scar left open: the dispatcher sits in front of every session's hooks,
a bad wiring blocks every tool call, and a tool call is the only thing the wiring agent has - on 09-15 the owner had to
run --off from a terminal by hand. This watcher runs DETACHED and needs no tool call: at the deadline it runs
hook_dispatch_wire.py --off unless ~/.claude/dreaming/HOOK_DISPATCH_CONFIRMED exists, which the wiring
agent creates only after seeing hooks fire and gates hold on its own calls. If tool calls are blocked, no file appears
and the wiring comes off by itself. Confirmed or not, it logs what it did to hook_dispatch.log.
