"""Health check for the math-brain injection hook: does it still SPEAK?

WHY THIS EXISTS. math_sense.py is fail-safe silent by design - it swallows every exception
so that a broken brain can never break or slow a session that is not doing mathematics.
That is the right default and it has one nasty consequence: a hook that is completely
broken looks exactly like a hook that is correctly staying quiet. On 2026-08-30 a missing
constant made _select raise NameError, and every campaign query silently returned an empty
block for several minutes. Nothing looked wrong. It surfaced only because the one query
being tested by hand happened to take that code path; the other control passed throughout,
because it never reached the failing line.

So this asserts the POSITIVE side: queries that must produce a block, and queries that must
not. Silence where a block is expected is the failure this catches.

    python math_sense_healthcheck.py          exit 0 if healthy, 1 if not

Run it after ANY edit to math_sense.py or to math_brain.rendering, and before trusting a
measurement taken through the hook.
