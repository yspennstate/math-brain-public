"""resume_checkpoint.py - a cross-reset breadcrumb (Altmann & Trafton, "memory for goals": a suspended
goal's activation decays across an interruption, and resumption is far cheaper when you left an
environmental pointer back into it).

Written on Stop, read first by the wake ritual, so a session that got compacted, crashed, or is brand
new picks up the thread it was mid-way through instead of cold-starting. Records the active work clock
(if any) and the gist of the last turn. Overwrites each turn - it's always the latest checkpoint.

Lives in the dreaming STATE dir, not the memory corpus, so the dream / salience / index never treat it
as a memory. Never blocks (writes a file, emits nothing). Fail-safe silent.
