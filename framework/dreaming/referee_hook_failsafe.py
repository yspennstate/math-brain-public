"""referee_hook_failsafe.py - behavioral fail-safety audit of the wired Stop hooks.

A Stop hook that throws, hangs, or emits a stray block on malformed input can wedge or disrupt a session.
The referee test: feed each wired hook GARBAGE (empty / non-JSON / {} / wrong-event) and confirm it exits
0, blocks nothing, and prints no traceback. Garbage only (never a real Stop event), so no hook's Stop path
fires - nothing mutates the shared RESUME.md / work clock / conscience / registry. Read-only + side-effect-free.
