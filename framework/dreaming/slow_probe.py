    Three rules, each from something this function actually did:

    1. A TIME BUDGET. Eighty opens at twelve seconds each is over twenty minutes; the recorded maximum for this
       stage was 1022.8 s inside a probe that fires every ten minutes. A measurement that outlasts its own
       interval is stale before it lands.

    2. NO SILENCE AT THE BAD END. The old version returned None below twenty successes, and the caller reads
       None as "cannot tell", which raises nothing - so the worse the disk got, the quieter the alarm became.
       Whatever was measured IS the measurement: seven opens in twenty seconds is a very slow disk, not missing
       data.

    3. STOP EARLY WHEN THE ANSWER IS ALREADY IN. A mean over twenty-five cold opens is not meaningfully worse
       than one over eighty, and on a healthy box all eighty cost under a tenth of a second so nothing is saved
       by stopping. It is the SLOW case where the sample is expensive - measured 2026-09-16, a busy box spent
       the whole 20 s budget here, 22.1 s of a 35.6 s probe run - and the slow case is precisely when an
       instrument should stop adding to the queue it is measuring. So: once there are `enough` opens AND more
       than `settle_s` has passed, the answer is in; go home.

    Returns (mean_ms, count). None only when the tree could not be sampled at all.

# spent 10.25 hours of CPU - and it is still at 1,628 ops/s while the physical disk shows about 96,

# every file walk on this box collapsed: 158,429 files in 3 seconds yesterday, a comparable 43,120-file
# tree in 3,336 seconds tonight. That is the signature of a cold metadata cache and this service is the
# only thing on the box with the op rate to keep one cold.
# I CANNOT PROVE THE LINK without stopping the service, which is the owner's call (decision 7 in his

# a few hours slow_cycles can correlate them. A hypothesis that needs an experiment nobody will run is

    `create_connection(..., timeout=1.0)`, and the timeout is paid IN FULL in the normal case - nothing

    The advisory that reports hung producers tells a READER to check the newest file in the

    Bounded on purpose: one scandir, no recursion, top level only, and any error means "unknown",
    which the caller treats as no suppression. It must never be the reason a flag is RAISED.

    THE WINDOW MUST MATCH THE WINDOW THE VERDICT IS BASED ON (raised 12 -> 35 min, 2026-09-17).
    The caller flags a producer only at `still >= 2`, which is three samples of a ten-minute task -
    twenty to thirty minutes of observed silence. Asking "did it write in the last TWELVE minutes"
    is asking about half that span, so a job whose write cadence falls between the two is flagged by
    a test its own evidence window would have cleared. Lived case: library_push.py gzips a 27.8 MB
    catalog and writes only when the gzip finishes - 74 s when the box was quiet, then 1360, 1374 and
    1355 s as it contended - so it emits nothing for 23 minutes at a stretch. I sampled its cwd twice
    twenty minutes apart and got 27.8 min stale and then 3.6 min fresh, and called the first reading
    a true positive. It was the same starved-not-hung case this function exists to suppress.
    35 minutes covers the three-cycle window with a margin and still leaves a genuinely dead producer

    scar where broad orphan-killing stopped live sessions.

    THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS WAS WRONG AND ITS FIRST FIRING PROVED IT. It sampled CPU and I/O over
    two seconds and flagged anything idle in that window. Its first hit was core_steer.py - the
    core-steering daemon this very probe tells people to expect - orphaned BY DESIGN because a VBS
    launched it, 72.7 MB written over its life, merely asleep between ticks. A two-second window
    cannot tell sleeping from hung.

    So the test is now a COMPARISON ACROSS RUNS: cumulative I/O is recorded each pass, and a process
    counts as hung only when its byte total has not moved across two consecutive probes - about
    twenty minutes - with the same pid and the same start time. A daemon that ticks at any interval
    under that clears itself. Returns (count, note, watch) where watch is carried into the next run.

    IT WAS WRONG A SECOND TIME, 2026-09-17, AND THE FIX IS THE SAME SHAPE. It judged a process by
    its OWN byte total, so every supervisor-with-workers read as hung: a parent that waits on
    children moves no bytes by design. The victim was harvest_loop.py, the owner's YouTube harvest -
    74 minutes old, 50 bytes written, orphaned because its windowless launcher exited - while its
    four children had moved 256 MB and yt_dlp was mid-download. The totals now include descendants,
    so the test finally means what the name says: this SUBTREE has produced nothing.

    KNOWN BLIND SPOT, stated rather than hidden: a producer that legitimately does nothing for more
    than twenty minutes - waiting on a long remote call, say - will be named. The verdict says
    "look", not "kill", and the note carries the age so a reader can judge. Both false positives so
    far were "idle is not dead" in different costumes; suspect that reading first.

    starvation: an eight-core reservation nothing was using, TEN CORES IDLE while six ran flat out. The
    2026-09-16 02:5x case looked identical on those three signals and was the opposite - every usable core at
    100 per cent with the owner away, which is what he asked for ("use the whole card and all the cores",
    2026-09-09) and what the governor itself calls owner_away_open.

    The difference is IDLE CAPACITY sitting beside the saturation, and it costs one line to measure. Cores 14
    and 15 are parked low-power cores that read zero always, so they never count as idle capacity.

    This matters because the two remedies are opposite: starvation says restore the missing cores, a full box

    renders, just on the owner's cores, and nothing reports it.

    ASK FOR THE NAME FIRST. The first version of this function called process_iter(["name","cmdline",...]),
    which fetches a command line for EVERY process on the box; measured 2026-09-16 that cost 16.8 s of
    processor and 25.6 s of wall clock, inside a probe that runs every ten minutes - the single most expensive
    thing the probe did, added by the same hand that wrote the note about instruments not becoming part of the
    problem. Fetching names, filtering to python, and reading a command line only for those costs 0.02 s of
    processor: the same answer for eight hundredths of the price.

    THE COUNT DROPS CHILDREN OF OTHER MATCHES: the film venv's python.exe is a shim that relaunches the base
    interpreter with the SAME command line, so a naive command-line count returns about twice the real number
    [[a_venv_python_shim_doubles_every_process_count_2026_09_16]].

    A render younger than three sweeps is not counted: it is still on the mask it inherited from its launcher
