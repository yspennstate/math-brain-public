"""Let a warm recall server live through a BM25 rebuild instead of exiting on it.

Why: each rebuild unlinks the old postings sidecar (~160 MB), and the server exited on the first one so the disk space
came back (5 Nov 2026). Rebuilds come every 15-35 minutes, so 92 of 117 server starts in the 24 h to 6 Nov 09:10 were
these exits, and the first live call of a fresh server took p50 1.33 s: 51% of all live recall time.

The one long-lived holder of a postings file in a warm server is brain._FC_DF (a _FcLazyDf with its own connection),
also reachable from brain_node_documents._IDF_CACHE, which is filled once per process and was kept current only by
those exits. release() closes and drops every _FC_DF entry for another file and clears _IDF_CACHE, then reports any
regular file of 1 MB or more this process still holds open with no name left on disk. The caller exits as before
when that list is not empty, so the disk always comes back.
