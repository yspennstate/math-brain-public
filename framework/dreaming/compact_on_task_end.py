"""Compact a session when it finishes a task (claude-322bc92e, 9 Oct 2026; his words 22:4x: "no make a hook that compacts
agents when they finish a task").

Why a hook cannot just call /compact: Claude Code takes /compact only as typed input. Its hook outputs are decision,
reason, stopReason, terminalSequence (OSC titles and bells only), additionalContext and the like; none compacts (read
from the 9 Oct binary). So on Stop, when the turn closed a task and the context is large, this hook starts a windowless
helper. The helper waits until that session is idle, then types "/compact" and Enter into that session's own console
(AttachConsole + WriteConsoleInputW). The keys go into that console's input buffer, never to the window that has the
focus. compact_nodes.py's PreCompact/PostCompact hooks then save the compaction as a node, as for an automatic one.

Guards: interactive claude.exe only (not -p/--print); context at least MIN_TOKENS; a task closed in this turn (a checklist
'done', or the end-of-task line "This was your ... ask"); once per COOLDOWN_S per session; the helper gives up if anyone
writes to the session while it waits (he may be typing) or it is not idle within WAIT_S; off while OFF_FLAG exists.
Idle means: the transcript quiet IDLE_S, the last turn ended and no queue-operation or loop fire since (a new turn shows
as a queue-operation before its user record is written), and no keyboard or mouse input for OWNER_STILL_S.

Proven 10 Oct on claude-322bc92e: the keys typed at 00:56:16 entered that session's queue (queue-operation enqueue
"/compact" at 21:56:16Z), and Claude Code ran /compact when the turn that had started 16 s earlier ended (22:03:02Z).
That turn was the reason for the 7-minute delay; the idle rule above now waits for such a turn to finish.

    hook (Stop, via hook_dispatch):  python -s compact_on_task_end.py          (reads the hook JSON on stdin)
    helper (started by the hook):    pythonw compact_on_task_end.py --inject PID TRANSCRIPT SESSION
    test the decision offline:       python compact_on_task_end.py --selftest
