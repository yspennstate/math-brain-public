"""Git pre-push gate: run scan_secrets.py on every range a push would publish, and refuse the push unless each scan
exits 0 (scan_secrets: 1 = possible secrets, 2 = the scan could not complete; both block). Installed as the
pre-push hook of a clone, it makes the rule "scan_secrets --range must print clean before the push" a property of
the push instead of the pusher's command line - pushes went out on a scanner error twice, both times from a chained command whose exit did not gate the push.

git calls the hook with the remote name and url as arguments and one line per ref on stdin:
    <local ref> <local oid> <remote ref> <remote oid>
The range is <remote oid>..<local oid>. A new remote ref (all-zero remote oid), or a remote oid this clone does not
have, scans from a base the remote advertises NOW: git ls-remote is read in the hook, and one rev-list --boundary of the
local commit against the advertised commits this clone has names the remote commits the new ones rest on; the one that
leaves the fewest commits to scan is the base. Since 4 Oct 2026: the merge-base search per advertised commit it
replaced started three git processes per ref, and a new branch on a remote with 776 refs waited 22 minutes; it remains
the fallback for any answer the batched search cannot read. Everything reachable from that base is already on the
remote, so every commit the new ref makes reachable is in the scan (it may scan more, never less). Until 28 Sep the base came from the local tracking refs, and a tracking ref left
ahead of the remote by a rewind (or behind it by a missed fetch) could leave a commit the push made reachable out of
the scan. The push refuses when the remote
cannot be read or none of its advertised commits shares history with the pushed one. A deletion (all-zero local oid)
sends no content and is not scanned. Git's hook environment (GIT_DIR and friends) is removed before the scanner runs,
because the scanner refuses inherited repository overrides.

The gate reads the commit graph the way the scanner does and the remote will: no replace objects, no grafts, no shallow
file. Until 28 Sep 20:5x its merge-base honored refs/replace while the scanner disabled replacements, so a local
replacement that grafted an unrelated remote commit onto the pushed history certified one commit and published three. Those three settings go only to the gate's
own git calls; the scanner sets them itself and refuses them inherited.

A new ref's base rests on some other ref of the remote (the witness), and that ref can move or be deleted while the scan
runs, which leaves commits the scan treated as already published newly reachable. After the scan the base is chosen again from what the remote advertises
then; a base the first range does not cover is scanned too, and after three moves the push is refused. What the hook
cannot close is the moment between its own exit and the remote's ref update: an update of an existing ref is guarded by
the old id git sends with it, a new ref by nothing but this re-check.
