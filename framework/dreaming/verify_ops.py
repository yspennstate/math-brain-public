"""verify_ops.py - PostToolUse on Edit/Write: when an agent writes mathematics, name the obligation a risky step opens
(30 Sep 2026, his 01:10 order: "hooks telling them to check proofs, ideas, code and so on with lean algorithms as well,
to audit their work").

The 30 Sep design review (Proof_Aware_Audit_Hooks_Design) asked that a check fire on an identified operation, not on a
theorem-related word, and that it arrive before the step is built on. So this reads only the text just written to a
.tex, .lean or mathematical .md file and looks for five operations whose side condition is the usual silent failure:

  divide    dividing, cancelling or multiplying both sides by a quantity: it is nonzero (positive, for an inequality)
            on the whole declared range, boundary included
  exchange  a limit, sum, derivative or integral moved past another: the licensing theorem and its hypothesis (a
            dominating integrable bound, monotonicity, uniform or absolute convergence) - pointwise convergence alone
            does not do it (f_n = n on (0,1/n): each integral is 1, the limit is 0)
  witness   'there exists ... for all': the witness is fixed before the for-all, so it may not depend on its variable
  finite    a claim checked on finitely many cases stated for all: numerical evidence, not the general case
  sorry     a .lean file with sorry, admit or a new axiom: not a proof until the kernel accepts it without them

A step whose justification is written beside it (the report's "clean near-miss") stays silent. One card per operation
per file per session, at most two per tool call. Patch hunks and MultiEdit entries are evaluated independently.
Logged to verify_ops_log.jsonl. Fail-safe silent.
