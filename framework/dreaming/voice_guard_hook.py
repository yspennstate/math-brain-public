"""voice_guard_hook.py - PreToolUse gate for public-facing prose (owner order 2026-09-09).

The owner, 2026-06-10: papers, READMEs, repos and anything published must read as if a human
wrote it - "headline" is an instant tell, no bold-fests, no emoji, state a correction once,
never write a note about sounding human. On 2026-09-09, on his personal website, he added a
second family: self-introspection about the artifact itself ("Every paper on this site will
get...", "the cards below track...", "click Abstract to read...") - prose that narrates the
page instead of saying the thing. The rule: anything that reads as machine-written comes out; the brain's
voice node fires early and is enforced by a hook, so the check does not depend on
anyone remembering it.

The voice_human reflex already existed but was ranked behind other reflexes and capped out
of the fire list on the very session that produced the tells. A rule that must always hold
is a spec for machinery (the ps1_guard precedent), so this hook reads the prose an Edit or
Write is about to put into a prose file and REFUSES the write when it carries a tell, naming
the tell and the line. The agent fixes the sentence and writes again. Nothing is blocked in
code, data, logs or private notes: only prose files (.html .md .tex .txt .rst .bib .markdown
and README-like names), and never paths under the brain's own memory/dreaming/audit trees,
where the notes are for us and quote his words verbatim.

Bypass: put the token  voice-ok  anywhere in the file (an HTML comment, a LaTeX comment)
for a file that legitimately quotes a tell (this hook's own docs, the brain memory).

Fail-open by construction: any internal error -> exit 0, no output. Cost: one regex pass
over the new text. Selftest: python voice_guard_hook.py --selftest
