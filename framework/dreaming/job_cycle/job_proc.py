"""job_proc.py - structural identity for a Claude Code session: which process, which terminal.

Owner's ask, 2026-07-26: "can you make it that this does not work with timing, it works with how the
terminal are built?" He is right, and the previous verification is the argument for him. The handover
ladder ended in two temporal rungs - `recency` (newest readme anyone filed) and the machine-wide
LAST_JOB.md - and when the clear was finally tested for real, the nearest rival pointer landed in the SAME
MINUTE as ours. It matched on the process id, so it was correct, but had it fallen through one rung the
answer would have been a coin flip. A tie-break on time is not an identity.

So identity comes from the process tree instead, measured here 2026-07-26 with six live claude.exe:

    explorer.exe 14644
      WindowsTerminal.exe 23616          <- SHARED by every tab. Never match on this.
        powershell.exe 24620             <- one per tab. THIS is the lane.
          claude.exe 23692               <- one per tab. A /clear does not restart it.
            bash.exe -> python.exe       <- hooks, three levels down

    claude 4256 <-host 23200   claude 23320 <-host 34180   claude 23692 <-host 24620
    claude 25284 <-host 13564  claude 33872 <-host 35032   claude 36544 <-host 25092

Every claude.exe had its own distinct powershell.exe. That is the discriminator; the terminal application
above it is not, and matching there would have unified all six tabs into one lane.

Two things make this an identity rather than a hint:

  Creation time. A pid alone is not unique over time - Windows recycles them, and the pointer that a pid
  match reads could have been left by a claude.exe that exited hours ago while an unrelated process
  inherited its number. (pid, creation FILETIME) is unique for the life of the machine. This is what the
  old six-hour POINTER_TTL was really guarding against, badly: a timer cannot tell a recycled pid from a
  live one, and six hours is both too long to be safe and too short to be correct.

  Liveness. A clear happens INSIDE a running claude.exe, so a pointer whose process is gone can never be
  legitimately claimed by anybody. That retires the TTL completely: pointers are collected when their
  process dies, not when a clock runs out, which is both tighter and unbounded in time.

Pure ctypes on purpose - no subprocess, so no console window is ever allocated (the owner's standing rule),
and no psutil dependency in a hook that must never fail. TABLE is the test seam: set it to a fake process
table and the entire ladder, including pid reuse, is unit-testable without spawning anything.
