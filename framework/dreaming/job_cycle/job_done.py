"""job_done.py - Stop hook: a job does not end until its readme is in the brain.

The cycle the owner asked for on 2026-07-26: job done -> write a readme -> put it in the brain -> clear
everything -> tell me what it did. This hook owns the first three and stages the fourth.

  1. Model finishes a turn that did real work.
  2. This hook BLOCKS once with the exact command to file the readme.
  3. Model files it (job_readme.py write) and reports to the owner.
  4. This hook sees the readme, lets the turn end, and tells the owner to press /clear.
  5. job_reseed.py hands the readme to the fresh context, so the clear costs nothing.

No hook in Claude Code 2.1.220 can clear the context itself - the hook output schema is a closed union and
none of its branches touch the conversation. Step 5 is what makes step 4 safe to do by hand.

Fail-safe silent, capped at 2 blocks per ask so a stubborn turn can never trap the owner in a loop, and
gated by the JOB_CYCLE_LIVE file (delete it to switch the whole cycle off without editing settings.json).

Job done - now close it out before you stop. The owner's standing rule (2026-07-26): every finished job
gets a readme, filed in the brain, so the context can be cleared without losing what happened.

1. Write the readme body to a temp file. Cover, in his voice, briefly:
   - What you asked        (his words)
   - What I did            (the actual moves, not a plan)
   - What changed on disk  (path - one line each; say "nothing" if nothing)
   - What is true now      (only what a tool actually showed you - no claimed greens)
   - Next / open           (what you would pick up first)
2. File it:
     python "%(cli)s" write --title "<short title>" --body-file "<temp file>"
   Add --remember only if this job taught something durable that belongs in the memory corpus.
3. Then write your normal final report to the owner, ending with the one-line restatement of which
   task this was (his words + the clock time), and tell him the readme is filed and he can /clear.

Do not re-do the job. Do not re-verify what you already verified. Just file it and report.
