"""task_checklist_hook.py - the owner's checklist of what they asked every agent, kept by every agent.

Design note: an owner who runs many agents at once asks different agents different things, and two failures
follow. Agents work on one ask without knowing another agent holds a related one, and the owner forgets what was
asked of whom. The checklist is the shared answer: every ask the owner gives an agent becomes a dated entry under
that agent, the agent checks it off when it is done, and a second checkmark records that the owner has seen the
result. When the owner wants to know what the agents are doing, an agent answers from the list, not from memory.

One file, three faces:

  hook mode   (--hook, stdin = the harness payload; Claude through hook_dispatch, Codex through hooks.json)
      UserPromptSubmit : an ask from the owner becomes a dated entry under this session's agent, in the owner's
                         words; a short follow-up ("ok do it") is attached to the session's open entry;
                         a question about tasks ("what did i ask the agents?") prints the whole checklist
                         so the agent answers from it. Every registration also prints what OTHER agents
                         have open, so nobody works blind.
      Stop             : records the agent's last activity on its open entry; fills "working on" from the
                         agent mesh when the agent never stated it.
      SessionStart     : prints the digest - open entries across agents, what is done and not yet seen.
  cli mode    (add / working / note / done / blocked / drop / reopen / seen / list / show / render / digest)
      the commands agents and the owner use by hand.
  selftest    (--selftest) positive and negative controls on a temporary store.

The store is one folder in the brain tree, ~/brain-repo/12_cognitive_architecture/task_checklist (TASK_CHECKLIST_HOME overrides it):
      ledger.jsonl   append-only, every event with its time, agent, runtime and session
      state.json     the folded state, rewritten atomically under a lock
      CHECKLIST.md   the rendered view the owner reads: open / done-not-seen / seen, grouped by date

Two checkmarks per entry: [x] done (the agent's) and [x] seen (the owner's). Times are the owner's local clock.
Never blocks, never raises out: any error -> silent exit 0.
