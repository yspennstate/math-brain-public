"""fire_judge_nightly.py - the judge pass on a cadence (built 2026-07-16, closing the
'repeatable model pass' leg of the heeding question).

Samples a handful of judgment-reflex fires from the last day (transcript-backed, UTC
windows - the 07-16 lessons baked in), renders them as a dream-agenda section with the
same blind protocol the 74-case run used, and the NIGHT DREAM judges them inline -
appending one JSON line per case to judged_nightly.jsonl. A slow series accumulates at
zero marginal cost; fire_telemetry can read its trend once it has volume.

Called by dream.py at agenda build (guarded). Standalone test: python fire_judge_nightly.py
