"""THE PRIMARY HOOK (the primary directive, 6 Oct 2026).

The directive: agents working together tend to drift into thought and wander off, so every agent connected to the
brain or the math brain is reminded every three minutes to work faster and more efficiently, to communicate, to find
the nearest bottleneck and clear it, to stay on its own task and to finish its deliverable, because other agents are
waiting on it.

What it does: on every prompt of every Claude and Codex session on this machine (they are all connected to the brain),
prints the line once per session per three minutes. Nothing else: it never blocks, never edits, swallows its own
exceptions, and its output is ASCII so no capture layer can choke on it. One switch turns it off for everyone:
C:/Users/me/.claude/dreaming/PRIMARY_HOOK_OFF (the partner's call only). State: primary_hook_state.json beside this file.

    python primary_hook.py                     Claude (the dispatcher runs it in-process; plain text is appended)
    python primary_hook.py --runtime codex     Codex (JSON hookSpecificOutput; Codex discards plain stdout)
    python primary_hook.py --selftest          four controls on a temporary state file; the live state is untouched
