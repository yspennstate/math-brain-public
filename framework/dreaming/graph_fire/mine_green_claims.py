"""mine_green_claims.py - mine the agent-voice claim turns that PRECEDED each
green_not_trusted correction, from the raw session transcripts.

Iteration 3 established that the green guard cannot be graded on owner-voice
correction wordings: an act-keyed guard fires on the AGENT's outgoing claim, and
that sentence lives in the transcript, not in MISTAKES.md. Each green correction
carries its session id; this script streams those sessions, finds the owner's
correction message by a distinctive verbatim fragment, and captures the assistant
claim turn the correction rebuts.

WINDOW (iteration 4 -> 6). At K=1 the miner captured only the single assistant text
message the correction INTERRUPTED. Iteration 4 found that interrupted turn is often
NOT the claim turn (yolo_mode's interrupted turn is "Want me to do that?"), so its
7/14 text-guard union is a window-limited LOWER bound. Iteration 6 widens the window:
buffer the last K assistant text messages before each correction and locate the claim
by a BACKWARD claim-shape search (newest->oldest) using a generic, guard-independent
effective-state/completion detector (CLAIM_SHAPE below). If no turn in the window
matches the shape, fall back to the newest turn (= K=1 behaviour), so no row is lost
and the selection is never forced onto a guard-firing turn.

Two unions are reported and never conflated:
  selected-turn union - the three text guards graded on the single located claim
      turn; directly comparable to K=1's 7/14 (also a single-turn number).
  any-in-window union - a guard counts if it fires on ANY of the last K turns; the
      honest ceiling a real rolling-window guard could reach.
The claim-shape selector is defined independently of the guards being graded
(overlapping in spirit - both detect "state achieved" - but a different pattern), and
every turn-changed row is meant to be eyeballed: selecting a spurious completion-word
turn would inflate the union by construction, so the report prints depth, change
flags, and turn tails for exactly that hostile check.

Output (with --write): green_claim_corpus_wideK.jsonl for K>1 (NEVER the frozen K=1
baseline green_claim_corpus.jsonl - writing to that path is hard-refused). One row per
correction: key, session, fragment, selected turn (tail-truncated, token-like runs
masked), the guard verdicts on it (guard_fired/claim/grounded/hedged, done_base,
reality_monitor - same field names the eval harness reads), plus provenance: depth
(assistant-messages back from the correction; 1 = interrupted turn), changed (differs
from the K=1 newest turn), matched_shape (CLAIM_SHAPE hit vs newest-fallback), and
window_any_{guard,done,rm} (did that guard fire anywhere in the window). Read-only over
transcripts; writes only the corpus, only with --write.

Usage: python mine_green_claims.py [--k N] [--out PATH] [--write]
  default --k 1 reproduces the frozen baseline selection exactly (regression anchor).
