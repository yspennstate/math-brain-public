"""ern_labels.py - label the ERN outcomes corpus with reflex families, so miss
budgets extend from named owner corrections to ALL logged real failures.

The outcomes ledger (dreaming/outcomes.jsonl, error_monitor.py) holds every logged
failure signature with the command text that produced it. ern_learn.py aggregates
shapes; nothing maps events to the reflex FAMILY that should have fired - without
that label the miss budget (miss_budget.py) covers only the ~80 owner-named
corrections. This produces ern_labels.tsv with stated coverage.

METHOD, two sources, both conservative:
  rule - definitional signature/content maps only, where the failure IS the family:
         mojibake -> utf8_text_surgery; leaked secret -> secrets_in_git;
         implausible magnitude -> sim_flatters (risk_vs_his_book secondary);
         ssh + eaten backslash escapes -> the ssh-backslash-eater family;
         a backslashed C:\\ path inside a bash command -> the drive-path family.
         No stretching: a generic traceback or non-zero exit is NOT evidence of any
         existing family and stays unlabeled rather than being force-fitted.
  hand - a stratified sample of the two big generic strata (non-zero exit,
         traceback), read by a person/agent and labeled family-or-none in the HAND
         table below (ts-keyed, reviewable, versioned with this file).

Unlabeled generic events are exactly the candidate-NEW-reflex gap ERN_LEARNING.md
already names (x127 non-zero exits etc.) - the honest statement is that they have
no existing family, not that they are covered.

Usage:
  python ern_labels.py            print rule coverage + the hand-label sample
  python ern_labels.py --write    write ern_labels.tsv (rules + HAND entries)
