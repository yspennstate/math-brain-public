"""pre_report_check.py - Stop hook: run the gut on the OUTGOING message before it reaches the owner.

Hooks see tool I/O, never the assistant's prose, so the worst class of mistake - a wrong number or an
over-claimed 'done' reported to the owner - had no firing surface (the #1 correction on 2026-07-11 was a
grid backtest reported ~10x under the measured record, with the reflexes silent because the number was in
prose). reality_monitor.py proved a Stop hook can read the last assistant message and block; this adds the
two checks it doesn't do, using the graph-firing engine + explicitly promoted report oracles:

  BLOCK (once per session, only on high-confidence signals):
   - a reported $ figure contradicts a scope-bound blocking oracle explicitly promoted in pre_report
     (there are currently none; remembered P&L observations are not present-tense truth); or
   - an ungrounded completion claim (finalized/populated/removed) with NO verifying observation in the
     turn - the he_will_look class reality_monitor's vocabulary misses; or
   - (2026-07-28) an ASSERTED dollar figure with no observation this turn and no provenance in the text
     (no source phrase, no artifact/path, not hedged) - the 'check the live feed before you report' class.

Legacy graph-fire branches are gated by graph_fire/ENABLED: absent -> SHADOW; present -> live.
The shared owner contract is live independently. Its explicit incomplete-financial-scope code
rechecks through stop_hook_active until corrected; other branches retain once/session dedup.
All errors fail open. Transcript-tail read follows the proven reality_monitor.py pattern.
