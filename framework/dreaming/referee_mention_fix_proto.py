"""referee_mention_fix_proto.py - PROPOSED fix for the mention-vs-act over-fire in graph_fire/pre_report,
validated before handing to the firing-engine owner. Does NOT edit pre_report.py.

Finding (referee_mention_block.py): the anchor-MISMATCH block path (and the stat-'sign' path) fire on
prose that QUOTES/CORRECTS a wrong number, not just asserts it - 4/7 mention sentences false-block.

Fix: a high-precision MENTION-FRAME detector. When the ONLY block driver is a mism or a stat-sign AND the
wrong figure sits in a self-correction / attribution / quotation frame, don't block. A fresh assertion
(no frame) still blocks; a SELL-VOL recommendation or an unhedged ACT drawdown still blocks (those are
directional errors, wrong even when discussed). Precision-first: only strong discussion markers excuse.
