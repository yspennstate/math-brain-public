"""math_sense.py - mathematical memory injection from the populated math brain.

On each user prompt: a cheap lexical gate decides whether the prompt is mathematical
at all (two distinct math anchors required - the general brain's measured polysemy
lesson). Only then is the population store opened and the overlay retrieval run with
strict abstention thresholds. Confident hits are injected as a compact context block:
definitions, lemmas, theorems with their exact statements, so agents connected to the
brain receive the mathematics they are thinking about mid-thought.

Ranking is done here rather than taken from retrieve() because two of the scorer's
channels are wrong for this surface. The graph channel propagates a seed's score to
its neighbours, and one closed cluster of campaign deposits owns enough of the store's
edges to collect that mass on almost any formal query; the symbol channel is pure
notation (subscripts, parentheses, commas) and elects the most notation-dense node
rather than the relevant one. Both are downweighted below, and no more than one
campaign deposit may take a slot - a cap, not a topic filter, because a trigger that
has to guess the subject gets it wrong. Measured at this exact surface.

Trust honesty: population nodes are CURATED_SECONDARY/UNVERIFIED until QA upgrades
them; the block says so. Fail-safe silent on ANY error - this hook must never break
or slow a session that is not doing mathematics. Reads stdin (UserPromptSubmit JSON),
writes injection JSON to stdout. Pure ASCII.

# the prefilter floor (21.9 and 21.7 against 17.5, ranks 5 and 7 of 300), so the drop is in RANKING - but several
