"""hook_liveness.py - is the data still flowing? A wired hook can silently die - its script deleted,
renamed, or broken by an edit - and nothing notices until a whole faculty has been dark for days. That
is the Azure-cutover shape (a green light while the thing behind it quietly changed). guard_audit.py
asks "is each guard exposed to its fault"; brain_status counts what the guards caught. Neither asks the
plainest operational question: for every hook settings.json says should run, would it actually run, and
is the data it produces still arriving? This does, and it's the observer the owner keeps asking for
("build useful observers, audit that data is flowing").

Four honest reads, kept separate because they mean different things:
  1. WIRING HEALTH  - every hook wired in settings.json: does its script exist and COMPILE? A missing or
     broken wired script is a genuinely dead hook - the real failure mode, caught here.
  2. DATA-FLOW      - the append-only streams a hook writes on every relevant event (outcomes, reality_log,
     coactivation, salience, spread_edges, reliability): age + whether they grew since the last run. A
     producer that stopped is a silent regression.
  3. FIRE-RECENCY   - each .X_fired.json stamp's age. INFORMATIONAL ONLY: danger/FONK/reality-block stamp
     only on a positive event, so a stale stamp means "no cause to fire lately," NOT "dead." Labeled so.
  4. CODEX CONTRACT - the independent hooks.json shape, pure warning-wrapper selftests, and privacy-safe
     Codex host counters. Claude wiring cannot prove that a warning reaches Codex.

Read-only except a tiny snapshot (.hook_liveness_snap.json) to measure stream growth run-to-run. Always
exits 0. Usage: python hook_liveness.py
