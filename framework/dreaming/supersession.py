# routed to the new law and loses the half that still stands. The recall collapse is right to substitute a wholly overtaken memory; the

# the overtaking was partial - predecessor at lexical rank 1 in 16/16, returned by full recall in 1/22 - and
# concluded that the repair belongs in the DATA, one memory at a time, not in a prose-reading collapse.
# `superseded_in_part:` is that data: a flow list of items `<clause in a few words> -> <successor slug>`. A memory
# carrying it is NOT routed anywhere (the resolver and the ledger never read it); readers FLAG it instead - recall
# prints `partly superseded: <clause> -> <slug>`, the association hint says which clause moved and that the rest
# stands, and a reflex compiled from it gets a hint line rather than a halved charge. One physical line, so every
# line-anchored reader in this codebase (superseded_by / status / created regexes) is untouched by it; valid YAML.

# leading YAML of all 15,875 memory files - 2.5 s per call on this machine, the largest fixed cost in
# brain.py recall after the embedding load. The targets change only when a file changes, so they are
# cached beside the index keyed by (size, mtime_ns); a run re-reads only new or modified files (a
# scandir over the directory costs 0.15 s). The cache is a convenience, never an authority: a missing,
# unreadable or malformed cache is simply rebuilt from the files, and the returned map is identical to
# the uncached one by construction (verified on the live corpus at landing: 389 routes, dict-equal).

# looked for in this call's own directory listing, never taken from the cache (IA-20260928-04).
# 4 (29 Sep, fleet03/B19 r75 and fleet02/B11 auto46): an entry is keyed by size, mtime, ctime and birth time,
# so a file replaced by rename with its old size and mtime is read again (Windows gives the renamed file a new creation
# time; POSIX changes ctime on any write or utime). The one case still read from the cache is an in-place write of the
# same size whose mtime is then set back to the same 100 ns on Windows; no writer here does that. Targets resolve
# through the folder's own file names, so a directory named *.md is never a memory, and a target renamed only in case
# keeps its route where the file system ignores case (normcase); where it does not, the spellings stay distinct.
