"""eval_pre_report_overfire.py - REFEREE: disconfirming over-fire test of the pre_report Stop
gate on REAL assistant prose, plus an adversarial probe of its named open gap (mention-vs-act: it can't tell
REPORTING a wrong number from DISCUSSING one).

The gate blocks the OUTGOING assistant message. Coverage was validated on authored cases; PRECISION was not
validated on the honest negative population = ordinary assistant messages. This measures should_block rate on
real assistant text sampled from the transcript archive, classifies each block, and probes the gap with
discussion/negation cases that SHOULD NOT block. Read-only; MEASURE, don't wire.
Usage: python eval_pre_report_overfire.py [n_transcripts]
