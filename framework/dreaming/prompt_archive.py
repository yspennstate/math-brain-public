"""prompt_archive.py - every prompt the owner gives an agent, saved in perpetuity, classified.

Owner directive (2026-07-09): "every single prompt that I give an agent is saved in a prompt file
in perpetuity, and is classified well - prompt for mistake, security, prove something, think about
something, improve something (whatever that prompt did)."

Two faces:
  hook mode (no argv)  : UserPromptSubmit -> append one JSONL line to memory/prompts/PROMPTS.jsonl.
                         Silent, fail-open, never blocks a prompt, never prints context.
  argv status          : one-line ledger read (count per class) for wake/status use.

The ledger is append-only and lives under the memory dir, so the nightly repo push preserves it
forever. Classification here is a cheap keyword PROVISIONAL tag only (a fast pattern cannot make a
content call - measured ~50% false-positive on content regexes, 2026-07-08); the real class is
written later by a model pass (backfill_prompts.py --classify writes class_model) and the nightly
dream classifies the previous day's new lines. Consumers should trust class_model, then fall back
to class_provisional.

Secrets: memory pushes to GitHub nightly (10 bot tokens shipped in plaintext once - 2026-07-08
scar), so obvious credentials are redacted BEFORE the line is written. The raw prompt is not kept
anywhere else by this hook.

Test seam: PROMPT_ARCHIVE_DIR points the ledger somewhere else so fixtures never touch the live
file (the ledgers-polluted-by-own-gate scar).
