"""hook_reaper.py - kill hook invocations the runner cancelled but never terminated.

Found 2026-09-07: when a UserPromptSubmit / PreToolUse hook exceeds its timeout, the Claude Code runner stops waiting
but does not kill the process. On a loaded box each cancelled hook (its python, plus a conhost) stays alive for hours
- twelve of them from the previous day were found orphaned at 12:4x, beside 54 dead sleep/tail/grep/console-host
pipelines. Every leak adds to the process count that makes the NEXT hook take minutes to start: the brain's own
plumbing was starving the brain. This reaper runs every 15 minutes (windowless scheduled task) and stops any hook
invocation that (a) is orphaned - its parent no longer exists - and (b) is older than MAX_AGE_MIN, matching the hook
by its exact operand (the dreaming/ hook scripts, the error-graph inline hook, the project-memory hook), never by a
substring that could match a shell or a peer's worker. Owner order of the same hour: turn off what is not doing
anything. Log: ~/.claude/dreaming/hook_reaper.log. Fail-safe: any error -> exit 0.

# Owner order 2026-09-07 12:3x: "fix the whole process for these so that this stuff gets automatically cleaned up every 20
# minutes by the brain and agents". Two victim classes, both ORPHANS ONLY (parent process gone - a hidden daemon launched by a
# VBS is an orphan by design, so the classes are narrow and named, never "any orphan"):
#   A. a hook invocation older than MAX_AGE_MIN (the runner cancelled it and never killed it);
#   B. a dead pipeline: sleep/tail/grep with no parent (older than 5 min), or a bash/cmd shell with no parent and no
#      children (older than 10 min). pythonw / python daemons and PowerShell scripts are NEVER in class B, and neither is
#      a console host (see the 12:51 scar below DEAD_PIPE: it dies with its owner and "no parent" says nothing).
# The healer rule (theta_probe_churn scar): every run logs candidates and kills, so a sweeper that kills a lot is itself the
# thing to inspect; it never restarts anything and never touches a process with a living parent.
# 12:51 on 09-07: the first live run stopped three "orphaned" console hosts aged 5-9 min - they were the consoles of a
# DETACHED test server's live claude sessions (start /b breaks the parent chain but the console is in use), and every
# in-flight item returned an empty envelope. A console host dies with its owning process; it is never a victim here.
# 2026-09-24 05:49: class B killed a LIVE grep, 12 minutes into a background `python ... | grep > file`
# run, and the python died with exit 120 when its pipe went; the same sweep took two other agents' 900 s and 1200 s
# sleeps. Git Bash is MSYS: bash forks, the child execs, and the forked Windows process exits, so EVERY program a bash
# script starts - each pipeline element, each sleep - has a dead Windows parent while its MSYS parent is alive. Measured
# the same hour on three live processes: all three had a dead Windows parent and a live MSYS parent. "No Windows parent"
# therefore said nothing about sleep/tail/grep/bash, and class B was killing any of them older than 5-10 minutes
# (214 sleeps, 210 greps, 154 tails, 66 bash shells since 09-07). The fix: an MSYS process is an orphan only when its
# MSYS parent is gone as well (Git's ps.exe gives PID, PPID and WINPID; an MSYS parent that died reparents its children
# to PID 1). No MSYS table, no class B for MSYS programs: without it the reaper cannot tell a live pipeline from a dead one.
