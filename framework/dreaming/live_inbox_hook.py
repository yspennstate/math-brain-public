"""live_inbox_hook.py - show a Claude or Codex session the messages waiting for it, within one tool call.

Before 1 Oct 2026 no hook on this machine read the agent mesh: a message sent to "claude-7fe30841" sat undelivered until
that agent ran `agent_mesh.py inbox` by hand (three hourly broadcasts to this very session were found that way), and the
dots' brain-inbox messages reached nobody until someone read the board. The relay (12_cognitive_architecture/live_inbox/
live_inbox.py) now turns every inbox message for a local session into a mesh message; this hook puts mesh messages in
front of their recipient:

  UserPromptSubmit / SessionStart   always look
  PostToolUse                       at most once every CHECK_EVERY_S = 3 s per session (a small state file otherwise)
  Stop                              mail waiting -> the stop is blocked and the mail is the next instruction; no mail,
                                    but the session talks with the dots and has no idle waiter armed -> it is asked
                                    to arm `live_inbox.py wait` in the background (once every 2 hours, and again
                                    right after its waiter has woken it, since a waiter ends when it wakes)

The session is the mesh agent "claude-<first 8 characters of the session id>" (codex-<8> for Codex); the hook keeps it
registered (pulse, or hello with the task it already had) so the relay and peers can address it. Inside a subagent it
stays silent, so a helper never takes its parent's mail. Messages are shown once, then stamped delivered (they stay
readable with `agent_mesh.py inbox --include-acked`). Output: plain text for the dispatcher, the hookSpecificOutput JSON
for Codex. Fail-open: any error prints nothing. Switch: ~/.agents/live_inbox/HOOK_ON (the dispatcher's enabled_if).
A message the relay fanned out because no session holds its name (topic brain-inbox-broadcast) is shown but never
blocks a stop or wakes a waiter: only mail addressed to the session does.
claude-7fe30841, 1 Oct 2026; the waiter offer, the broadcast rule and the 3 s look by claude-7fe30841-inbox the same
evening (his 22:3x order: "messages go through right away and prompt the other agents")."""
