"""schema_supersede.py - stamp a machine-readable `superseded_by:` field on memories that a later
memory corrects, so the stale-fact/conflict eval (and recall-time demotion, later) have a real basis.

The 2025-26 agent-memory literature (Zep bi-temporal knowledge graphs; the Supersede paper; MemConflict)
isolates UPDATING - use the current value of a fact, discard the superseded value - as a failure distinct
from retrieval quality: more memory budget does NOT fix stale-fact use. The prerequisite is knowing which
memory supersedes which. This brain has 160+ memories with prose correction language ("now superseded by
W#24", "the $586k correction", "turned out wrong") but almost none machine-readable, so nothing can
measure or act on supersession. This closes the write side.

Two tiers, honest about what a fast pattern can and can't do:
  RULE tier (safe to auto-apply): an EXPLICIT link - "superseded by [[slug]]", "supersedes [[slug]]",
    "correction to [[slug]]", or a dream's "WARNING superseded: [[slug]]" note. The target is named, so
    no judgment call - stamp `superseded_by: <slug>` on the OLD memory (idempotent, append-only field).
  DREAM tier (needs model judgment): a memory whose PROSE says something was corrected but names no
    target slug ("the earlier number was wrong", "actually it's X"). A regex cannot pick the right
    earlier memory (measured ~50% false-positive on content classification), so these are only LISTED
    for the nightly dream to resolve - written to supersede_candidates.tsv, never auto-stamped.

Safety: default DRY-RUN (prints what it would stamp). --apply writes, but ONLY the frontmatter field,
ONLY on files unchanged for >120s (never races a live edit), and never on a dream-owned view file.
Idempotent: re-running stamps nothing new. Usage:
  python schema_supersede.py            # dry-run: show rule-tier stamps + count dream-tier candidates
  python schema_supersede.py --apply    # stamp the rule-tier links
