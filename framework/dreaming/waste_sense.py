"""waste_sense.py - the hook that keeps every session honest about what it leaves running.

Owner order 2026-09-07 12:5x: "tell all the agents to judge their idle workers, and make a hook dedicated for this so
that agents are always told to clean up their work." Registered on UserPromptSubmit and Stop. On each fire it lists
the LIVE PROCESSES DESCENDED FROM THIS SESSION (the claude.exe this hook runs under: workers, shells, servers, loops it
spawned), the box totals (processes, console hosts, node workers, the governor's mode), and injects the judgment
the owner asked for: for each descendant, is it producing for anyone? idle, finished-but-alive, duplicated, a poll
loop nobody reads, a shell left open = waste - but since 2026-09-18 the owner has banned shedding load to free resources
(shedding makes everyone start over), so REPORT it and leave it running; only your own finished shell
fragments that own no work may be reaped. At Stop
(end of turn) it says: before you leave, stop what you leave behind, or name why it must stay.

Quiet rule: on UserPromptSubmit it speaks once per session per 20 minutes, and always when the session has more than
8 descendants or the box is past 900 processes or the governor reads throttle/distress. Fail-safe: any error ->
silent exit 0. Reads stdin (hook JSON), writes injection JSON.
    python waste_sense.py --selftest

CHANGED 2026-09-07 13:1x his clock, on "i don't need to see this output, for the waste hook please, fix it so that i
don't see it, i prefer a report hook that had the agent give a report on what they did": the Stop event is now SILENT.
A Stop hook that injects text re-prompts the model, so the old Stop injection produced a fresh one-line process verdict
after every reply (fifteen in a row in the building session, 13:0x). The census is for the agent's own judgment and is
never to be recited to the owner; what the owner wants at the end of a task is a short report of what was done, what
was stopped, and what was left running and why. That instruction now rides on the UserPromptSubmit injection so it is
in context before the work starts. The Stop registration was removed from settings.json and ~/.codex/hooks.json
(backups *.bak_wastesense_stop_20260907); a stray Stop fire returns nothing.

# AMSI scan stopped answering), the census went stale after its 15 minutes, and from then on every UserPromptSubmit in
# every session spent the dispatcher's whole 90 s budget in this rebuild ("waste_sense.py rc=1 90.0s timed out", seven
# fires in three minutes): one stuck system service became a 90 s wait on every prompt on the machine. The cached rows
# stay true for every process still alive (see below), so a stale cache is still used under the live overlay; a rebuild
# is tried at most once per CENSUS_RETRY_S whoever fires, and it gets CENSUS_REBUILD_TIMEOUT_S instead of 300 s.

# THE CACHE NOW HOLDS ONLY WHAT NEVER CHANGES (2026-09-23). A process's parent, image name, start time and command
# line are fixed for its whole life, so a census of any age still describes every process that is STILL ALIVE and
# was alive when it was taken. What goes stale is liveness and the processes born since - and those come on every
# fire from one Toolhelp32 snapshot (no process creation, no per-process handle). So a fire overlays the live
# snapshot on the cached rows and rebuilds the PowerShell census only when the cache is older than
# CENSUS_MAX_AGE_S. Why: the 180 s TTL below still rebuilt on 21 of 23 prompts after the ancestor walk landed
# (19:40-20:22, median 2.9 s, max 56 s), because fleet-wide prompts arrived every two to three minutes and each
# PowerShell start cost up to 10.6 s on the loaded box; and the same measurement found 89 of 954 cached rows dead
# 11 s after the census was taken - a cached row can name a pid that is gone or already reused, which matters
# because the orphan line tells agents to reap by pid. The overlay drops the dead and treats a pid whose parent or
# image changed as a new process.
# THE HISTORY OF THE OLD TTL, kept because its measurements still describe the traffic:
# 45 SECONDS WAS SHORTER THAN THE TRAFFIC IT CACHES (measured 2026-09-18 from the dispatcher log).
# The gap between consecutive UserPromptSubmit events FLEET-WIDE - which is what matters, because this
# cache is shared across every session - has median 84 s over 831 intervals: p25 29, p75 177, p90 316.
# So a 45 s TTL was fresh for only 33.3 pct of prompts and TWO THIRDS of them paid the full PowerShell
# enumeration this cache exists to avoid, which is why waste_sense measured a 4.72 s median and a
# 13.48 s p90 on the prompt path rather than the cost of a JSON read. 180 s is the observed p75 and
# lifts the hit rate to 75.2 pct; 300 s would give 88.9 pct and is the next step if this holds.
# WHY A STALER CENSUS IS STILL A CORRECT ONE: the report it feeds is throttled to REFIRE_S = 1200, so a
# three-minute-old process population cannot change what a twenty-minute cadence says. The docstring's
# own argument - the population does not move meaningfully, and no loud condition is second-by-second -
# holds at 180 s exactly as it did at 45. The exactness that MUST survive is the caller's own tree; it used to be
# guarded by refusing a cache without this process's parent in it, and since 2026-09-23 it comes from the live
# snapshot on every fire instead (census() and _overlay).


def _census_live(timeout=300):
    # DO NOT SWAP THIS FOR psutil. That change was made and REVERTED on 2026-09-18, and the reason is not
    # obvious from here: this box does not stall on SPAWNS, it stalls on the PROCESS TABLE. One
    # Get-CimInstance is a single process-table operation that returns CommandLine for every process;
    # psutil.process_iter needs a HANDLE PER PROCESS, measured at 29 ms each - 4,272 ms across 618.
    # Timed back to back in one quiet minute psutil looked seven times faster (0.78 s against 5.89 s) and
    # that number is what sold the change; production said 7.84 and 11.00 s against a 6.78 s before-median
    # and it was reverted byte-identical within two prompts. A 7x median gap inside a 60x variance (psutil
    # itself ran 0.78, 1.19, 0.35 then 50.82, 2.26, 1.44 the same minute) is not a finding.
    # If you want this hook cheaper, do not make the census cheaper - take it OFF the prompt path, so a
    # fire never rebuilds: one scheduled producer writing the cache, a TTL that covers its cadence. The
    # cost that matters is WHO PAYS FOR THE PROCESS TABLE AND WHEN, not which binary reads it.
    # Measured 2026-09-18: this hook is 2,516 s of 7,419 s of all logged slow-hook time on the box - the
