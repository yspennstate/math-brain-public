"""math_brain_regression_gate.py - the nightly gate that would have caught this week's silence in one night.

Between 2026-09-07 and 2026-09-11 three landings stacked on the math lane and the hook went from serving the
right theorem on 84 pct of a fresh bank's questions to 35 pct. Nothing noticed for four days because the two
evaluators that existed were run by hand, after a landing, by whoever remembered - and the in-process one could
not see the gate that did the damage. This runs the four instruments THROUGH THE REAL HOOK PATH every night,
appends one row to state/regression_gate.jsonl, renders state/REGRESSION_GATE.md (the dashboard's panel), and on
a breach sends one mesh message so a live agent sees it.

    python math_brain_regression_gate.py            run everything, exit 0 on PASS, 1 on BREACH, 2 on an instrument error
    python math_brain_regression_gate.py --quick    health check + proof-sense selftest only (about a minute)

Thresholds are the 2026-09-11 post-repair numbers with slack, not aspirations: a breach means "worse than the
day the gate was written", which is the question the gate exists to answer. Raise them deliberately after a
measured improvement; never lower them to make a night green.
