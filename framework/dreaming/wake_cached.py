"""SessionStart hook for source "compact": hand back the wake this session already received, without re-running it.

Why: on 16 Oct 2026 an agent kept stalling after every compaction. Measured that night:
wake_brain.ps1 parts 1 and 2 re-ran on every compaction and took 390 s and 393 s for one session (01:14-01:21 local
time), 224 s / 162 s / 163 s for three other sessions - PowerShell alone took 35 s to start on the loaded laptop.
The agent sat silent the whole time, and on a 300k window with a ~160k floor it compacts every 15-25 minutes.

Startup, resume and clear still run the full wake_brain.ps1 (settings.json matcher "startup|resume|clear"). After a
compaction this prints the same session's own last emitted wake part (brain_health/wake_full/claude_<sha256(sid)>_partN
_emitted.txt, written by wake_brain.ps1), or, when the session has none, the newest one of any session from the last
12 hours. Silent on any error: a missing wake never blocks the session.
