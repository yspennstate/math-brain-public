# rem_watch.ps1 - the REM session's watchdog, counted in WORKING time (dot-sourced by run_dream.ps1).
#
# Why (2026-09-25): the watchdog counted 45 minutes from LAUNCH. On a loaded machine a headless session's start-up
# hooks can take most of that before the model says a word - the 20:21 REM retry spent 27 minutes in its SessionStart
# wake and prompt hooks, reached its first turn at 20:48 and was killed at 21:06 after three turns. The same wake took
# under a minute at 19:34. Start-up time is the machine's, not the dream's; the budget should be the dream's.
#
# Wait-RemWorkingTime returns $true when the session exits by itself and $false when it must be killed:
#   - no first model turn by Launch + BirthMin: dead at birth (the 09-15 case), so the runner can retry. run_dream.ps1
#     passes BirthMin = WorkMin = 45: the hook caps alone (three SessionStart and two prompt hooks, 600 s each) can pass
#     35 minutes, so an earlier cut could kill a live session, and 45 is when the launch clock killed it anyway.
#   - otherwise at FirstTurn + WorkMin, and never after Launch + CapMin (the runner passes 2 x WorkMin).
# The first turn is read from THIS attempt's transcript, found by a mark unique to its prompt (the hard-cap stamp).
# ASCII only (wake-path discipline).
#
# run_dream.ps1 dot-sources this file before any step runs. Without it the REM wait is an unknown command, the
# error unwinds the cycle's try block, the log still ends 'dream cycle complete', and every step after REM is skipped
# while the REM session runs on unwatched. Ship it beside run_dream.ps1.
