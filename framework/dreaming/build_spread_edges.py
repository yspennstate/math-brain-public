"""build_spread_edges.py - compile the association graph the spreading-activation recall walks.

Recall today is lexical: fok_probe/instinct_prime match the prompt's words against filenames and
index lines. That structurally can't find the memory that matters but shares no vocabulary - the
distant, "this reminds me..." connection a person makes. Spreading activation (Collins & Loftus
1975; Anderson's ACT-R) does: light up what the prompt touches, let activation flow along the
association graph, and see what downstream node glows that you wouldn't have grepped for.

This merges the two association signals the brain already keeps into one weighted edge list the
online hook can load fast (the walk must run inside an 8s hook, so the heavy parse lives here):
  - Hebbian co-activation (coactivation.tsv): memories the brain actually READ TOGETHER while
    reasoning. The lived signal - strong, but young and sparse, so on its own it just echoes the
    last few sessions' hubs. Weighted higher (W_COACT) because "reasoned with together" is a
    truer link than "an author once cross-referenced."
  - Wiki-links ([[slug]] in memory bodies): the hand-authored backbone - rich (3000+ links) and
    stable, so it carries the walk while the Hebbian graph fills in.

Undirected, deduped, symmetric. Node ids are memory slugs (filename without .md), links resolved
the way dream.py does it (strip a trailing _YYYY_MM_DD, fold - / _) so [[a-b]] finds a_b_2026.md.
Read-only over the memory dir; writes spread_edges.tsv. Rebuild in the dream / nav build.
