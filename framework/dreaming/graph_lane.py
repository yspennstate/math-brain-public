"""graph_lane.py - the use-grown graph as a lane of brain.py recall, behind one dial.

Built 26 Sep 2026: the edge and diffusion part, with a parameter that tunes it against the simple lexical
recall. The edges are graph_store.py's store (built over the capture of every touch agents
make: words, tools, files, folders, memories read and written, notes served, reflexes, errors); the diffusion is
diffusion.py's personalised PageRank over them, seeded by the query's words and, with prf > 0, by lexical search's
top memories (what agents read together with what bm25 already found).

    BRAIN_GRAPH_LAMBDA   the dial: 0 = today's recall order exactly, 1 = the graph's order alone
    BRAIN_GRAPH_STORE    the store to walk (a graph_store.py output folder)
Defaults for both, and for the walk's own parameters, are in brain_graph_dial.json beside this file.
