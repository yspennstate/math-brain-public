"""run_dream.py - the MECHANICAL dream cycle for the brain (macOS/POSIX port of run_dream.ps1, minus REM).

Same order and the same log markers the wake check reads ("generating dream agenda", "dream cycle complete"):
  guards (STOP file, exclusive dream.lock) -> dream type by hour (sws < 09, nap < 16, rem) -> consciousness.py and
  dream.py under caps -> the mechanical tail (index, views, reflexes, graph, embeddings; each step capped, its exit
  code logged) -> "dream cycle complete".

THE REM PHASE IS NOT HERE. On Windows run_dream.ps1 launched an unattended headless Claude session with permission
checks disabled to consolidate memories. On this macOS that needs the owner's explicit decision (it is a standing
permission bypass and spends his model quota); until he makes it, dreams are mechanical-only and the wake check will
say the REM phase did not run. Also not ported: dream_git_sync (install step 12), the owner duration request.

usage: python3 run_dream.py [--type sws|nap|rem|mixed]
