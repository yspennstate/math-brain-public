"""Recall's display floor skips a low row; it does not end the list (28 Sep 2026; the 0.02
display cutoff).

On the bm25-first path recall's list runs in segment order - the BM25 block (floored at 0.05), then the lexical, graph
and semantic tails - not by display score. The display loop used to end at the first row scoring 0.02 or less.
 A1 a tail row at or below the floor that precedes a row above it: the later row is shown
 A2 at most n rows, in the order given
 A3 rows at or below the floor are never shown
 A4 with floor_break=True (BRAIN_RECALL_FLOOR_BREAK=1) the old stop returns, and fails A1 (the check can fail)
 A5 the rows before the first low row are the same under both rules, and the new rule only adds rows after them
 A6 recall() itself uses _display_rows (the function under test is the one that runs)
