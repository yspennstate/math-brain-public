"""control_random_graph.py - the negative control eval_fusion_weights' verdict leans on.

Question: is graph-dominant recall's edge over lexical-dominant a REAL held-out-co-read prediction, or a
structural artifact of the graph being BUILT from co-reads? Test: degree-preserving random rewire (double-
edge-swap keeps every node's edge count and the weight multiset, randomizes WHO connects to whom). Re-run
current vs graph-dominant vs lexical-dominant on the REAL graph and the REWIRED graph.
  - If graph-dominance still wins big on the rewired graph -> the win is degree/structure, not the specific
    edges -> reject reweight (and be humble about the live hook's graph-dominance).
  - If the win COLLAPSES on the rewired graph -> the real edges genuinely predict future co-reads -> the
    signal is real (for the proactive/co-read mode), the live hook is validated, reweighting the deliberate
    CLI still needs its own ground truth but the finding is not an artifact.
Light: 3 blends x 2 graphs x 3 splits. Read-only. Usage: python control_random_graph.py [--swaps 10]
