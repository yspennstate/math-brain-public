"""One command that says whether the brain's recall is actually working.

Written 2026-07-28 after a session lost measurable work to a recall gap that was
already flagged: memories were written, indexed, and invisible, because the
semantic sidecar had not rebuilt in days and the lexical index predated them.
Filing a defect is transport; this is the verifier.

Laptop-safe: reads coverage state and queries BM25. No model, no network.

    python check_brain_recall_health.py

Exit 0 when both arms are healthy, 1 when either is degraded, so it can gate a
nightly job. Prints what to do about each failure rather than only that it failed.
