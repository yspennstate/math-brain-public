"""backfill_origin.py - add origin / repeat_of / repeat_n to PROMPTS.jsonl, additively.

The live hook now stamps these (prompt_archive.py -> prompt_origin.stamp). This fills in history:
7,001 records - every live-hook record from 2026-07 onward - carried no `origin` at all, so
build_prompt_views.py's `origin == "automation"` branch was dead across the whole recent period,
and nothing could separate an ask he typed from a /loop cron re-fire of it.

Rules, deliberately conservative:
  - never change an existing field value; only ADD absent ones
  - never touch ts / session / cwd / source / text
  - a record that gains nothing is re-emitted BYTE-IDENTICAL (the ledger is CRLF and any
    re-serialisation of 18k records is 18k chances to corrupt one)
  - decode strict: errors='replace' would bake U+FFFD into records permanently
  - `count` (backfill-era: occurrences collapsed INTO one record) is a different quantity from
    repeat_n (separate records of the same ask). Do not add them together.
  - the ledger is live and append-only, so re-read the tail immediately before replacing and carry
    over anything a hook appended while this ran

Usage: python backfill_origin.py [--apply]   (default: dry run)
