"""brain_recall_server.py - a resident process that answers `brain.py recall` with its built state kept warm.

RECALL-10X lead 1 for brain.py. A cold `brain.py recall` spends most of its CPU
reloading state from disk (file caches, the superseded map, listings, tiers, archived index lines, query
expansions, node documents, the fresh-memory scan). This process loads brain.py once, memoizes those reload
functions, and serves recall calls from brain_recall_client.py over localhost.

Correctness rules:
- Every memo is dropped when the state signature changes (memory folder, MEMORY.md, the BM25 index, the
  embedding sidecar, the superseded index, the graph sidecar) and at most STATE_TTL seconds after it was filled.
- The server exits (after answering) when any brain module it imported changed on disk, so a code change is
  never served by old code; the next client call runs cold and starts a fresh server.
- A call whose BRAIN_* environment differs from the server's is declined, and the client runs cold.
- One call at a time; a call that would wait more than LOCK_WAIT seconds is declined (client runs cold).
- Exits after IDLE_EXIT seconds without a call, or when its working set passes RSS_CAP.
Launched windowless by the client (python.exe with CREATE_NO_WINDOW, so its own children inherit a hidden
console). Read-only on the brain except what recall itself writes (its usage logs). Never deletes anything.
