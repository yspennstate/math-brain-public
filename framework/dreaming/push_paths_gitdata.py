"""Land a scanned commit's paths on origin/main through GitHub's Git Data API, as ONE commit.

Called by push_paths.sh after the git push lost the tip race (main moves about once a minute; a git retry costs a
22 s fetch plus the push hooks on the loaded box, so it loses again). Here a retry is a tree + commit + ref update,
about two seconds. The content is read from the scanned commit C0 (never from disk), so what lands is what the
secret scan saw. Before each try the new tip is compared with the tip the scan was built on: a path a peer changed
in between is refused, as push_paths.sh's own retry refuses it. The ref moves only by fast-forward (force false).

usage: push_paths_gitdata.py SLUG BASE C0 MSG path1 [path2 ...]     token in env PP_TOK
exit 0 landed / 3 refused or failed / 4 the API itself is unusable here (caller may try another route)
