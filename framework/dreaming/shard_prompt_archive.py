"""Publish the prompt ledger to the repo as immutable MONTHLY shards.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The ledger `memory/prompts/PROMPTS.jsonl` is append-only and had reached
56.9 MB (16,139 records) by 2026-08-17. GitHub warns past 50 MB and HARD-REJECTS a push at
100 MB, and the nightly mirror copied the whole monolith into the repo, so every commit stored
another ~57 MB blob. On its measured growth that wall was months away, not years - and the way
you find it is the push that fails, with the brain's backup as the casualty.

THE SHAPE OF THE FIX. The LIVE ledger is never touched: 27 modules read it by its own path and
the UserPromptSubmit hook appends to it, so changing it would be a wide blast radius for a
storage problem. Only the REPO COPY changes. Records are grouped by the month of their `ts` and
written as `prompts/archive/PROMPTS_<YYYY-MM>.jsonl`. A closed month never changes again, so git
stores it exactly once, forever; only the current month's shard is rewritten, and at the measured
rate that is about 6 MB. The largest shard is 2026-06 at 31 MB and it is now immutable.

LOSSLESSNESS IS ENFORCED, NOT ASSUMED. Nothing is written unless every source line is accounted
for: the shards are compared to the source as a multiset of exact lines, both directions, and the
run aborts before replacing anything if the check fails. Lines that do not parse, or that carry no
usable `ts`, are NOT dropped - they go to PROMPTS_UNDATED.jsonl so the round-trip still balances.
Writes are atomic (temp file + os.replace) and only happen when content actually changed, so a
crash cannot leave a half-written shard and an unchanged month does not churn the repo.

Usage:
    python shard_prompt_archive.py            # publish shards, print the manifest
    python shard_prompt_archive.py --check     # verify only, write nothing (exit 1 on mismatch)
