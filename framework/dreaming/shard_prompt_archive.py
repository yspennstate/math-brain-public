"""Publish the prompt ledger to the repo as immutable MONTHLY shards.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The ledger `memory/prompts/PROMPTS.jsonl` is append-only and had reached
56.9 MB (16,139 records) by 2026-08-17. GitHub warns past 50 MB and HARD-REJECTS a push at
100 MB, and the nightly mirror copied the whole monolith into the repo, so every commit stored
another ~57 MB blob. On its measured growth that wall was months away, not years - and the way
you find it is the push that fails, with the brain's backup as the casualty.

THE SHAPE OF THE FIX. The LIVE ledger is never touched: 27 modules read it by its own path and
the UserPromptSubmit hook appends to it, so changing it would be a wide blast radius for a
storage problem. Only the REPO COPY changes. Records are grouped by the month of their `ts` and
written as `prompts/archive/PROMPTS_<YYYY-MM>.jsonl`. A closed month never changes again, so git
stores it exactly once, forever; only the current month's shard is rewritten, and at the measured
rate that is about 6 MB. The largest shard is 2026-06 at 31 MB and it is now immutable.

LOSSLESSNESS IS ENFORCED, NOT ASSUMED. Nothing is written unless every source line is accounted
for: the shards are compared to the source as a multiset of exact lines, both directions, and the
run aborts before replacing anything if the check fails. Lines that do not parse, or that carry no
usable `ts`, are NOT dropped - they go to PROMPTS_UNDATED.jsonl so the round-trip still balances.
Writes are atomic (temp file + os.replace) and only happen when content actually changed, so a
crash cannot leave a half-written shard and an unchanged month does not churn the repo.

A MONTH PAST PART_CAP IS PUBLISHED IN PARTS. A busy month can outgrow one file: with agents on
five-minute loops one month reached 67.8 MB and the next 32 MB in six days. A secret scanner that
refuses objects over 64 MB then blocks the whole push, and GitHub refuses anything over 100 MB. Such
a month is written as `PROMPTS_<YYYY-MM>.pNN.jsonl`, broken only at day boundaries and filled from
the 1st, so a closed part never changes when later days arrive. A month under the cap keeps its one
file, so nothing already published churns.

Usage:
    python shard_prompt_archive.py            # publish shards, print the manifest
    python shard_prompt_archive.py --union-existing  # merge a partial ledger into existing shards
    python shard_prompt_archive.py --check     # strict local-ledger audit, write nothing

Union mode preserves existing shard order and the maximum occurrence count of every exact
line across the archive and local ledger. It does not deduplicate repeated ledger entries.
Fetch/merge the latest repo archive before publishing; this is not a concurrent-writer lock.
--check always audits against the local ledger, even with --union-existing: archive-only rows
still fail that audit until the ledger is reconciled. Union publishing instead verifies the
exact merged multiset, including archive-only rows, both before and after writing.
