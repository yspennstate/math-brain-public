"""suggest_links.py - propose missing [[wiki-links]] the hand-authored backbone is missing, using
the graph-structure signal that beat raw co-read count at link prediction (eval_linkpred, 07-10).

The wiki-link backbone "carries the walk while the Hebbian graph fills in" (build_spread_edges), but
it is hand-authored and therefore incomplete - two memories about the same method or program often
share many neighbours yet were never directly linked. Adamic-Adar (sum over shared neighbours z of
1/log(1+deg z)) is the classical link predictor for exactly this, and it is CAUSALLY VALIDATED here:
on pairs with NO wiki-link pre-split, AA predicts which get CO-READ after the split at AUROC
0.76/0.71/0.81 (3 splits, 2026-07-10) - so a high-AA unlinked pair is a real latent association, not
noise. (It does NOT help the online walk's reach - that was measured and rejected, eval_walk_norm; its
value is offline curation, not runtime ranking. See memory brain_graph_linkpred_2026_07_10.)

This is a READ-ONLY curation aid: it RANKS and REPORTS candidate links for the dream / owner to author
by hand. It never edits a memory or the graph - auto-adding edges would mutate the non-stationary graph
the walk runs on, the churn the brain-method memory warns against. A human/dream decides which to link.

Output: link_suggestions.md (top-N pairs, each with descriptions, the shared-neighbour "bridges" that
explain the association, and the current direct co-read count). Read-only, fail-safe.
