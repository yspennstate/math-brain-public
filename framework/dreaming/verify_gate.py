"""verify_gate.py - Stop hook: a claim needs a check that could have failed on it.

The design goal (30 Sep 2026): Lean checking is part of the math brain, and agents connected to it are
prompted by hooks to check proofs, ideas and code with Lean, to audit their work, and to plan how to verify it
in more than one way. verify_sense.py asks for the checks when the work
starts; this is the other end. It reads the message about to reach him and the turn's own tool calls, and blocks once
when the message claims something that nothing in the turn could have refuted:

  R1 stale check   the message says fixed / tests pass / verified / works, the turn edited code, and no check ran
                   after the last code edit (a check that ran before an edit says nothing about the edit)
  R2 Lean claim    the message says Lean-checked / kernel-verified / compiles in Lean / sorry-free, and no Lean ran
                   in the turn, or the last Lean run did not support it: an error or a sorry, a failure or unrecorded
                   exit, or a lean_check receipt short of the claim (a kernel-checked or formally verified claim needs
                   FORMAL_TARGET_VERIFIED; "compiles in Lean" needs only a compile)
  R3 proof claim   the message says proved / QED / the proof is complete / holds for all n, no computation, test or
                   Lean ran in the turn, and the message does not say what rung the claim reached (sketch, conjecture,
                   numerical evidence, unverified)

Each claim is judged with the hedges and record references of its own sentence (and of the next one when that one
refers back, "This is only a sketch"): an unverified side remark elsewhere in the message does not excuse a claim, and
the noun "conjecture" is not a hedge ("the FEI conjecture is solved" is a proof claim). A command is a check only when
it ran something and returned: reading, echoing, listing or searching a checker's file is not running it (the dot's
audit of these hooks, PR 184, 30 Sep).

Reads Claude transcripts and Codex rollouts. It blocks whether or not the stop is a continuation (in a /goal session
every stop is one, and a gate that stood down there would never fire where most of his work happens). Two limits keep
it out of a loop and out of the way: the stop right after one of its blocks, in the same turn, is never blocked (that
stop is where the agent's answer to the block is logged), and a rule blocks once per turn - the user prompt the work
answers - and again in that turn only after REARM_S and for a different claim. Until 30 Sep 03:0x it was once per rule
per session, so a session reused for a second task never met the gate again (1000-page report D12-T02); until 30 Sep
12:4x the stop after a block was spared even when it answered a new prompt. Every decision is logged to
verify_gate_log.jsonl with the evidence it saw, and the next stop after a block logs what the agent did about it (checks
added, claim kept or softened). A block lands after the claim is written, so its follow-ups measure correction, not
prevention (report D11-T02, D16-T03); verify_sense.py and verify_ops.py are the before-the-step channels.
verify_gate_SHADOW beside this file makes it log without blocking. Fail-safe: any error -> silent.
