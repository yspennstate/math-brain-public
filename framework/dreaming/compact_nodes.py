"""Every compaction becomes its own brain node, connected to the nodes it relates to (owner, 9 Oct 2026 17:0x-17:2x:
"save all of the compact information as a node", "every single compact should be saved as its own node and connected
to other compact stuff", "every single compacting should be turned into a node and connected to relevant nodes"; and
19:0x: "make sure that the compact methodology we developed is working and turning the compact files into nodes with
edges").

Claude Code runs this on two hook events (settings.json "PreCompact" / "PostCompact"):
- PreCompact (input: trigger, custom_instructions): prints instructions that Claude Code hands to the summarizer, so
  the summary keeps what the work needs afterwards (open asks, ids, commits, paths, claims, the NEXT line).
- PostCompact (input: trigger, compact_summary): saves the summary as its own node.

Each compaction is written twice (9 Oct 19:1x):
- the full summary under ~/.claude/brain_graph/compactions/<date>/<name>.md (brain data, never deleted);
- an anchor memory <name>.md in the memory folder: a bounded excerpt (the ask, the pending tasks, the current work, the
  next step), a pointer to the full summary, and [[links]] to the compaction hub, the session's previous compaction,
  other sessions' compactions on the same checklist tasks, and the memories brain.py recall finds closest. The anchor is
  what makes the compaction a node of the brain: bm25 recall indexes the memory folder, and build_spread_edges.py turns
  its [[links]] into graph edges. Anchors get no MEMORY.md line (that index is loaded into every session).
Before 19:1x the nodes lived only under brain_graph, where neither recall nor the graph looks, and one compaction was
lost: the hook read its input in the console code page and a stray surrogate made the UTF-8 write fail.

`--sweep` backfills what a hook missed: compact_boundary records in Claude transcripts (the summary is the next user
record) and 'compacted' records in every Codex home's rollouts (~/.codex*/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD). Codex has no compaction
hook and the pool's workers run hookless, so the sweep is how their compactions become nodes. A byte cursor per file
(sweep_state.json) keeps repeat sweeps cheap; a compaction already saved is never saved twice (same text, or the same
session within ten minutes). compact_hooks.py starts the sweep in the background at most every 15 minutes.

A subagent's compaction reaches the hook with its parent's session and no agent_id (Claude Code 2.1.296), and the
agent's own compact record can land in its transcript after PostCompact fires; so the sweep also runs attribute(), which
finds each unattributed row's summary in the session's agent transcripts, files the row under that agent and re-chains
`previous` within each identity (12 Oct). `--attribute [--days N] [--dry]` runs that pass alone; `--refresh-gists
[--dry]` rewrites the anchors whose description ended in a bare <summary> tag (the gist before 12 Oct).

The compactions tree is brain data under the 26 Sep law: never deleted. A hook must never break a compaction, so every
error is swallowed and logged to compactions/errors.log. COMPACT_NODES_ROOT overrides the store and COMPACT_ANCHOR_DIR
the anchor folder (tests); COMPACT_NO_RECALL=1 skips the recall call."""
