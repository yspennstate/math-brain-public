"""The private-label guard must fire on every spelling a leak actually takes.

This guard reported "clean" on 2026-08-10 while eight tracked files held a real home
directory, because its rule matched `[\\/]` - exactly ONE path separator - and a path
written inside a source literal carries two. It also never opened .vbs files, which are
the ones most likely to hardcode a path. Both are fixed; these are the controls, and they
live here rather than in a throwaway script so they travel with the guard.

The negative cases matter as much as the positive ones. The guard's own docstring says a
check that fires on correct code teaches people to skim its output, so the placeholders
that documentation legitimately uses must stay silent.
