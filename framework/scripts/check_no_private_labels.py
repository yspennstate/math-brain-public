"""Fail if the framework tree carries the owner's private vocabulary.

This repo is the framework; the brain that runs on it is not. The two live in the same working
directory on the author's machine, so a file copied across without thinking carries reflex ids,
memory slugs, and system names that belong on the private side. That happened once already: an
earlier sync put private-stack reflex ids and a named private memory into this tree, and it was
caught by reading the files rather than by anything that could fail.

The rules in this file are shapes only: home directories, project slugs, routable addresses. The
names of a particular person's hosts, repositories and vocabulary are data, and this file is
published, so they live in a local rule file that never leaves the machine (see
_local_private_rules). The checker scans itself like any other file, so "clean" covers the rule
table too.

Run it before a push:  python scripts/check_no_private_labels.py
Exit 0 = clean, 1 = something private is in the tree.
