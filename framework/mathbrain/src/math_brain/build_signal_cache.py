"""Build the read-only index-signal cache for the store.

retrieve() indexes every node on every query. Profiled 2026-08-30 over a 3191-node store,
that was 4.07s of a 6.7s call, and it took the injection hook to 2.6-3.7s per prompt against
its own 2.5s budget. The signals are a pure function of the node text, so the work is
identical every time and can be done once.

This script does it once. The hook loads the result read-only and never writes it, so two
sessions running concurrently cannot race on the file. Re-run it after any bulk ingest.
