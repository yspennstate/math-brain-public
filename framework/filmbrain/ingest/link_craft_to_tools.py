"""
Wire the authored craft graph to the harvested tool surface.

Without this the brain is two disconnected things: a book about filmmaking and
a list of ffmpeg options. With it, "how do I stop this looking computer
generated" can answer with motion blur, grain and a defocus AND name the exact
filter that does each one on this machine.

The mapping is CURATED, not fuzzy-matched. A keyword match between "grain" and
"grain extract" would fill the graph with plausible-looking rubbish, and a
wrong edge in a reference is worse than a missing one.
