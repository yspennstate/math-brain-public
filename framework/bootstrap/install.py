"""Stand up a fresh brain from this repository.

Copies the machinery into the standard home layout, expanding the repo's
install-time tokens, creates the state directories and seed memory files, and
generates the hook-wiring JSON for your agent runtime's settings. Dry-run by
default; pass --apply to write.

    python bootstrap/install.py --project-dir C:\\Users\\me [--timezone UTC] --apply

memory corpus lives under <HOME>/.claude/projects/{{BRAIN_SLUG}}/memory where {{BRAIN_SLUG}}
is that path with ':' and path separators replaced by '-' (the transcript-dir
convention used by the agent runtime).
