"""Firing-sequence audit: read the reflex-firing shadow log and report how the
subconscious is actually behaving - which reflexes fire, which fire TOGETHER (the
cascade structure), how the rate trends, and where habituation may be needed.

This is one of the three signals the development loop watches ("how firing sequences
are going"). It is read-only and cheap; run it any time, and once per dream so the
cascade structure is tracked over the program.

Input: a shadow-fire TSV whose lines are
    <epoch> \t <session-or-verdict> \t <comma-separated reflex names> \t <context text>
(the exact columns vary by logger; the reflex-name column is auto-detected as the
first column that looks like a comma-joined set of snake_case names).
