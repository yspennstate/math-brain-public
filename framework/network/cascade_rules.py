"""Cascade rule mining over the firing log: do stable reflex cascades exist, where
seeing a SUBSET of them reliably predicts another reflex firing?

This is the owner's "if 5 fire in a certain way... the correct node fires" made
measurable. It is association-rule mining (Agrawal 1993) over the co-firing sets in the
shadow log: frequent reflex itemsets, then rules {A,B,C} -> D scored by support (how often
the antecedent fires) and confidence (how often D fires given the antecedent), lifted over
D's base rate so a ubiquitous consequent doesn't look predictive. A high-confidence,
high-lift rule is a real cascade: the antecedent firing is genuine evidence the consequent
should fire, which is exactly a cascade that can complete to the missing node.

Read-only over the firing log. `python cascade_rules.py [shadow-fires.tsv]`.

    rules whose consequent is RARE (low base rate -> high lift) are worth surfacing - a
