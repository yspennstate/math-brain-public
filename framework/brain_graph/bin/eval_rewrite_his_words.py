"""eval_rewrite_his_words.py - does the rewrite before search help on HIS wording? (27 Sep, claude-825b1305)

recall_rewrite.py was measured on model-reworded bank questions (+9 points at top 5). This asks the same of his own 56
owner-voice questions (eval_brain_recall_fresh BANK + BANK_V2_EXTRA) and his 82 real first prompts
(eval_prompt_recall_fullstack.episodes), on the live index: plain `brain.py recall` against recall_rewrite.py (three
Haiku rewrites, four searches interleaved). Per question: the plain rank (top 8), the fused rank (first 20 lines), and
whether any of the four searches has the answer in its own top five. Neither log is written (BRAIN_RECALL_LOG=0,
RECALL_REWRITE_NO_LOG=1). Counts only in the result; rows stay in the study folder.
