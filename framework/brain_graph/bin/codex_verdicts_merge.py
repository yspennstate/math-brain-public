"""One record of his Codex corrections, repeats and praise from the two derivations (28 Sep 2026, claude-825b1305; the
scheduled audit jobs R25 and R30).

Two files derive his verdicts in Codex sessions:
  - the ledger's (codex_verdicts.py, events_verdicts_codex.jsonl): prompts of the prompt ledger with origin "owner",
    today's patterns, keyed to the session's full id only where the prompt's own text proves it;
  - the capture's (capture/extract_codex_events.py, the "verdict" rows of events_codex.jsonl): UserMessage items of the
    sessions he drives (codex-tui or the desktop app), with the patterns as they were when each rollout's bytes were
    first read, and never recomputed.
This settles every row on which they disagree by reading the prompt itself. A capture row is re-read from its rollout
(the UserMessage at that second) and is
  - automation: the ledger holds the text and no owner origin for it -> not his, dropped;
  - stale pattern: today's patterns (codex_verdicts.verdicts_of) do not give that verdict -> dropped;
  - ledger gap: his text by the capture's own test, today's pattern gives the verdict, the ledger lacks the prompt ->
    kept and labelled;
  - keyed apart: the ledger has the prompt as his and gives the verdict, but under no key or another second -> kept once;
and a ledger row the capture lacks is explained (no rollout, a session the capture does not count as driven, a prompt
over 4,000 characters, the capture's text test refusing it, a pattern the capture's older rows lacked). The merged
record is the rows both hold, the ledger rows and the capture rows kept above, each with its basis. No prompt text is
written: a row carries a 12-character hash of its prompt.
