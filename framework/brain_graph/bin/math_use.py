"""math_use.py - the math brain's use-grown layer: claims that get used grow, claims used together connect (26 Sep).

His order of 26 Sep 15:5x: the brain live, "the edges growing and learning, including for math brain". The math store
(the math store) has typed edges written by its builders (depends_on, cites, supersedes ...) and
math_sense.py ranks claims mostly by words; nothing in it grew from use. This is that layer, from what the math hook
actually served and what agents actually fetched:

  size   each claim's use history - every time the hook served it into a session, and every explicit fetch (weight 2) -
         read as an ACT-R base level, ln sum over uses of age^-0.5 (hours), squashed to 0..1 across the claims
  co     claims served into the same session are one co-activation; NPMI over sessions (positive part) is the edge, so
         a claim used with the ones this session already has lights up (Hebbian, as the voice note asks)
  score  0.5 size + 0.5 max NPMI to a claim this session was already served; math_sense multiplies its own rank score
         by (1 + MATHBRAIN_USE_WEIGHT x score), default weight 0.15: a tilt among close candidates, never an override
Sources: .math_sense_sessions/<shard>.json (served sets per session, since the shards began), mathbrain_fetches.tsv,
and live/math_serves.jsonl, which math_sense.py appends to on every serve from 26 Sep on (log_serve). Rebuilt hourly by
run_graph.py capture (build()); read by the hook through scores().

Only real sessions count (27 Sep): a serve, shard or fetch is use when its session is his (an interactive Claude session
or a Codex cli/vscode thread) or a script (any other headless Claude session or Codex thread). The recall benches' test
workers (first prompt '[headless-worker]') and callers with no session of their own - the math evaluation harnesses,
which give each question a fresh id - are counted in 'skipped' and learned from not at all. On 27 Sep that left one
session's shard of 13,242 and no fetch: the layer is nearly empty because real sessions have rarely been served math.
