"""test_orders_channel.py - controls for the membrane's standing-orders channel (27 Sep).

    python test_orders_channel.py [PATH_TO_live_membrane.py]      (default: the installed one in bin)

Against the live sidecar and his memory files (read only; nothing is written outside a temp dir):
 1 a superseded order resolves to the end of its chain (his GPU orders are chained two deep)
 2 no candidate the channel returns is itself superseded, whatever the query
 3 order_facts reads the order's own date and the parts later overtaken
 4 the served text names the date, the overtaken parts, and a newer order on the same ground when one ranks close
 5 decide(): nothing is served with serve_orders off
 6 decide(): with it on, a leader that has led once is not served; twice, above the bar, it is (kind 'order')
 7 decide(): below the bar, or in a headless session, nothing is served
 8 decide(): the same order is not served again inside the refractory, once when it has passed, and a memory the
   session has read is not a candidate
