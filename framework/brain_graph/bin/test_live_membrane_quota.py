"""Controls for the membrane's six-hour memory quota and who spends it.

A memory reaches at most two other sessions in six hours. Before this change a bench test worker counted as one of the
two, so two workers that drew a memory kept it from his next session. These controls check that test workers no longer
spend the quota, that his sessions, scripts and unknown receivers still do, and that the receiver's kind is read from
its own transcript.

    python test_live_membrane_quota.py [path/to/live_membrane.py]     (default: the copy beside this file)
Exit 0 when every control passes.
