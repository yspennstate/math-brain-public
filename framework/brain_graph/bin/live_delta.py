"""live_delta.py - the brain graph's fast layer: what the hours since the last store build taught it (27 Sep, claude-825b1305).

His words, 27 Sep 17:1x: "the data should be live, i don't understand why we are stuck in the past, and the graph should
also be temporal". The store (graph_store.py) is rebuilt every six hours from a capture that ran hourly, so the membrane
read edges up to seven hours old and knew nothing of a file, folder or memory first touched since the last build (at
17:2x, 43,518 events in the log were newer than the store). This layer holds exactly what the store does not yet have:
the touch events appended to events_touch.jsonl after the store was built, turned into context -> target edges by the
store's own rule. A target is something a session needed (a memory read, a failed call, a sampled tool, the first touch
of a file, folder, project, repository or host); every distinct item of the same session in the 600 s before it adds to
item -> target, an error also to item -> err:ANY, and the store's hubs add nothing. Each edge and node carries the time
it was first and last seen, and its weight fades with the store's half-life from the moment it happened, so the
membrane can put both layers on one clock: the store's counts faded to the moment asked, plus these.

Rebuilt from scratch on every run from the log's tail (a few MB), so nothing drifts or counts twice: the six-hourly
build folds these events into the store, and the next run starts over on the new base. His corrections are not here
(the store takes them from events_verdicts.jsonl only, and they run in shadow). Co-activation pairs are not here either
(only the attractors and the recall walk read them, and those follow the store).

Written to live/delta_<stamp>.sqlite and named by live/delta.json, which is replaced atomically, so a hook holding the
previous file open keeps reading it. Only the newest three files are kept: they are rebuilt from the events and are
never the only copy of anything.
