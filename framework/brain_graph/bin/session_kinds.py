"""session_kinds.py - whose session was this? One answer for every part of the brain that learns from use (27 Sep, claude-825b1305).

Since the recall benches started (24 Sep) most of what the brain logs as use has been tests, and each consumer found it
separately: the recall learner and the membrane (04:07), the usage record (04:51), the math brain's use layer (05:2x),
the use-grown graph store (not yet). A scheduled audit (account02/B13, 27 Sep) put it plainly: a rule that repaired one
consumer was not made a rule for its neighbours. This module is that rule; the consumers import it.

  his      an interactive session: a Claude transcript whose entrypoint is cli, or a Codex thread from cli or vscode
  test     a headless Claude session whose first prompt starts '[headless-worker]', the prefix our own tools give the
           workers they start: the recall and brain benches and their graders, the question writer (doc_expand), the
           query rewriter, the brain framework's project-memory reviewers. Their reads answer a tool's question, not a
           task of his (27 Sep, last 3 days: 2,365 such sessions against 33 of his and 431 other scripts)
  script   any other headless run: a Claude sdk-cli session (the dream, film workers, campaign solvers) or a Codex exec
           or subagent thread
  unknown  no record here - an evaluation harness's own id ('vib-<uuid>'), a Codex session this machine keeps no thread
           for, a transcript too new to show its entrypoint, or an 8-character key two sessions of different kinds share

Use is 'his' or 'script'. Keys are a whole session id or its first 8 characters (the touch events and the recall log key
sessions by 8); a Codex id begins with the clock, so threads started in the same minute share their first 8 characters,
and such a key resolves only when every session under it has the same kind. Settled kinds are cached in
live/session_kinds.json; 'unknown' never is.
