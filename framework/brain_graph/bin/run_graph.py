"""run_graph.py - keeps the brain graph growing by itself (26 Sep).

His order of 26 Sep 04:28: build the whole edge and diffusion part of the brain now, from the data we have. The capture
(transcripts -> touch events) and the graph store (the learned edges) had run by hand from a session scratchpad; this
driver runs them from their durable home, ~/.claude/brain_graph/, on a schedule:

  capture   every hour: the new bytes of every Claude transcript touched in the last 40 days become touch events,
            appended to events_touch.jsonl (byte offsets in capture_state.json), then the learner and the rest of
            the hourly live lane
  fast      every five minutes (27 Sep, his 17:1x: "the data should be live, i don't understand why we are stuck in
            the past"): the same capture, the memories written since the last pass, and the fast layer
            (live_delta.py) rebuilt on every event the store has not seen yet, which the membrane reads beside it
  build     every six hours: store/ rebuilt from all the events (written to store.new, checked, then swapped in);
            GraphStore(~/.claude/brain_graph/store) is what the membrane, graph_recall.py and the diffusion read.
            The hour either side of any touch of the recall banks is left out (graph_store.BANK_RX), so a ranker tuned
            on a bank against this store is not scored on answers the grading itself taught it

Each run takes a lock the operating system holds (released when the run ends, however it ends), runs BelowNormal and exempt from
Windows power throttling, refuses to build with less than 3 GB of commit headroom, and appends one line to
logs/run_graph.log and the latest state to STATUS.json. Launched windowless by run_graph.vbs (wscript //B, pythonw).
A build or an hourly capture that finds a run in progress waits up to three minutes for it; a fast run skips.
