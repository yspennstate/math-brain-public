"""Bind each row-level source decision to the exact row content it judged.

The source check of the 10 Aug batch judged 75 rows by reading their text against their sources, but its decisions
named rows only by table and id, so nothing tied a decision to the content that was read. This adds row_sha256 to every
decision: the sha256 of the row as stored, taken from the live store and accepted only when the row is byte-identical to
its first record (the backup named in the decision, the one the first-record check found minutes after the write). A
decision whose row cannot be matched that way gets no hash, and the re-seal refuses to apply over it.

    python bind_source_decisions.py DECISIONS.json POPULATION_DIR OUT.json
Only reads the store and the backups (read-only connections). Prints OUT's sha256, the value the re-seal's
--decisions-sha256 must name.
