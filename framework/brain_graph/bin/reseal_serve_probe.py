"""reseal_serve_probe.py - does the math hook serve the 10 Aug curated cards before and after the re-seal? (28 Sep,
claude-825b1305; the served-block comparison registered at 10:2x, first a targeted look.)

Today the hook's last read (selection_integrity -> current_note.read_current_note) refuses a card whose stored node
digest matches neither the node nor its body ("stored_node_digest_mismatch"), and the 34 curated nodes of the 10 Aug
batch are exactly such cards; none of them appears in the serve archive (24-26 Sep, 12,811 records, 319 distinct cards).
This asks the hook, as its own process per prompt, one targeted question per card family on two stores: a byte copy of
the live store and the same copy re-sealed as a dry run (reseal_math_rows.py --first-record), each with the live object
folder beside it. The hook code is the livepost80 arm (the live hook, block for block); the environment is the campaign's
rehearsal environment with MATHBRAIN_STORE pointed at each copy. It prints which batch cards each block serves.
