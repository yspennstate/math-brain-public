"""study_scar_fire_before_repeat.py - when he had to restate one of his standing orders, did a reflex for that order
exist, and did it fire before he had to?

Each labelled correction (results/STANDING_ORDERS_LABELS_2026-09-27.json) names the orders it restated as memory slugs.
A reflex is linked to an order when its source names the slug (strict) or any of its fields does (loose), and counts only
if it existed before the correction (a learned reflex by its "added" stamp; a seed reflex is taken to exist). Each case
gets one class, first match wins:
  no linked reflex
  fired between his ask and his correction          (instinct_fires logs, the correction's session)
  matched there but held back                        (instinct_suppressed logs: the cap or the backoff)
  fired earlier in the session only
  never matched in the session
The registered classes never looked at holds BEFORE his ask, so a reflex matched and held earlier in the session fell
to "never matched in the session". Since 28 Sep 14:1x each row also carries
held_before_ask and class_with_preask_holds, where such a case reads "matched earlier in the session, held back each
time"; the registered "class" and "classes" are kept as registered.
