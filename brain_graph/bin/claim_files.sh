# Claim (or assert) each file named on the command line on the agent mesh, one resource per file, the Windows path built
# with sed so no backslash passes through a command string. Inline loops of the form ...\\$n.py claimed the literal
# resource '...$n.py' (the Bash tool collapses a double backslash before the shell runs, and bash then reads \$ as an
# escaped dollar).
#   MESH_AGENT=<your mesh id> bash claim_files.sh claim|assert PURPOSE FILE...     (FILE as /c/Users/... or C:/Users/...)
#   MESH_AGENT=<your mesh id> bash claim_files.sh run PURPOSE FILE... -- COMMAND [ARG...]
#   MESH_AGENT=<your mesh id> bash claim_files.sh release FILE...     (no purpose; exit 3 unless every one was released)
# Exit 3 when any claim is refused or any assert fails: stop, as the protocol says.
#
# run claims every FILE, asserts every FILE, and only then runs COMMAND (its exit code is the script's). If any claim is
# refused or any assert fails, COMMAND never runs. It exists because 'claim ...; write' does not stop on a refusal:
# twice on 27 Sep (15:4x a memory write under another agent's index claim; 16:2x a run-log append while this agent's
# own registration had lapsed) the refusal printed and the write after the ';' ran anyway.
