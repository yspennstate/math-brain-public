"""frontier_digest.py - what the math store holds on the open problem a research session is working, delivered to it.

The math hook serves cards when a prompt asks a mathematical question, so a session that spends many hours on one
program sees few of them while other agents add results on the same problem. This module gives a session on a program
the program's frontier once, and after that only what was added since.

Every item says where it comes from: "literature YEAR" (the card carries a citation or a literature/arXiv source),
"textbook" (an encyclopedia source), "the authors' paper", or "house, unrefereed" with "proof on file" or "no proof on
file". Supersession is read from the store's SUPERSEDES edges as well as node metadata, as of the digest's moment, so a
result withdrawn by an edge stops showing as current from that moment. A short section after the results lists what was
withdrawn as wrong (with the correction's own reason) and refutations, then the cards that record a failed route or a
refuted citation ("Failed route ...", "REFUTED CITATION ...", "Known false ..."), the routes a session should not walk
again. results/earlier-tests/frontier-digest-t16-t17-2026-09-24 measures the digest on research plans.

Standard library only; the store is opened read-only and resolved when a function is called.
  python frontier_digest.py --digest FEI [--at "2026-09-23T18:00:00"]   print the digest as of a moment
  python frontier_digest.py --delta QFORM --since "..." [--at "..."]    print what was added in between
