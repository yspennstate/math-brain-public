    """Record that someone followed the served block's pointer.

    Added 2026-09-13, to answer a question the campaign could not: the served block is a SELECTION plus a
    pointer ("Full note: python math_note.py SOURCE_ID"), and whether a card's truncated statement matters at
    all depends on whether readers follow that pointer. The 09-12 A/B's solvers did - its arm scored the page
    families 260/260 while the captured blocks alone answered 1 of 90 - but nothing records what ordinary
    sessions do, so the whole cards-versus-statement-length trade rests on an assumption. One line per fetch
    makes it a measurement. Best-effort and never fatal: a note read must not fail because a log is unwritable.
    The session column read CLAUDE_SESSION_ID, which Claude Code never sets, so all 146 fetches of 13-26 Sep carry
    no session; the tool shell's variable is CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID (27 Sep). Of the 13 sessions found fetching in
    their transcripts, 11 were the recall benches' test workers, which is why math_use.py counts a fetch only when
    its session is a real one. CLAUDE_SESSION_ID still comes first: only an evaluation sets it (eval_proof_banks,
    eval_ownvoice), to label its run, and inside a session's shell that label must not become the session's.

    A fourth column, since 30 Sep, is the read's outcome: ok, or failed:<exit code>. The row used to be written before
    the note was read, so a refused read (an invalid id, a missing note, a digest mismatch) was logged like a full one
    (account04/B19, B19-R79-MATH-NOTE-LOGS-FAILED-FETCH-AS-READ-20260929); math_use.py counts only ok rows and the
    three-column rows before it, whose outcome is unknown.
