"""math_prefilter.py - a lexical candidate filter so the math lane (math_sense.py) scales past a few thousand nodes.

retrieve() scores every node on every query (about 0.4 ms per node with the signal cache): fine at 5,000 nodes,
18 s at 46,000 - the literature layer built 2026-09-07 (every math.PR statement harvested for the probability
bank) is ten times the production store. This module keeps a small inverted index beside a store
(<store>.prefilter.pkl: token -> postings with term frequency, document lengths) and returns the K best node ids
for a prompt by BM25; math_sense then loads ONLY those nodes from sqlite and runs its unchanged ranking, gates
and rendering over them. The full-store path is untouched when no index file exists, and every error here falls
back to it (the hook must never break a session).

    python math_prefilter.py build <store.sqlite3>      write <store>.prefilter.pkl
    python math_prefilter.py query <store.sqlite3> "<text>" [K]

Tokens: the same casefold + NFKC as retrieval.tokenize, alphabetic runs of 3+ chars and LaTeX macros, minus the
lane's stopwords; a token that occurs in more than 20 percent of nodes carries no weight. Pure Python, no deps.

# a coin toss over the family, so the row the question named never reached retrieve(). The df cap (build()) moved
# from 0.2 to 0.5 of the store the same day, because that family is 28 pct of the store and every one of its words
