"""test_fastrecall_rebuilt_store.py - the fast path never answers from a state the store has left behind.

    python test_fastrecall_rebuilt_store.py

Builds a three-claim store in a temporary folder, runs math_recall.py once so the fast path prepares its state,
then deletes the store and builds a one-claim store with different text at the same path. The next call must not
print a claim that is no longer in the store, and its output must match the call with the fast path off
(MATH_RECALL_FAST=0). A second check covers the ordinary case: one claim appended to the store is found by the
next call. HOME points into the temporary folder, so the prepared states never touch the real cache.
Needs only the math_brain library and its dependency, cryptography. Takes about 20 seconds.
